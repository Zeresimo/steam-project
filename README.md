# Steam Data Analysis & Pipeline Project

A 5-part project exploring the Steam Web API with Python â€“ from basic API calls to building a full data system.

## Project Overview

### 1. Data Collection

* Fetch raw game data from the Steam API.
* Save datasets for further processing and analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

* Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.
* Normalize and prepare datasets for analysis and visualization.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyze trends in game genres, ratings, and release dates.
* Generate visual summaries and statistical insights.

### 4. Visualization & Dashboard

* Build interactive visualizations to explore the dataset.
* Include filters for genres, release year, and other attributes.

### 5. Capstone / End-to-End Integration

* Combine collection, cleaning, EDA, and visualization into a single pipeline.
* Provide a comprehensive view of the data, highlighting key insights.

## Features

* Automated data fetching from APIs.
* Structured and clean datasets ready for analysis.
* Visualizations to explore trends and patterns.
* Optional dashboard for interactive data exploration.

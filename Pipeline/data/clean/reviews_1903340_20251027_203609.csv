1903340,"Extremely well made, and fun. Normally I can't stand turn based gameplay, but there's a couple things you can do on the enemies turn to counter. It makes it interactive even when it's not your turn adding a level of skill to it. Compared to other turn based games that you have to eat the enemies attacks, in this you can completely counter, and get a attack out of it. I'm not far into the game as of writing this review, but so far the story is really fun, and the combat looks really engaging with how much it gives you to work with.

Definitely a one of a kind type of game.",True,1761491292,689,4

Most overhyped mediocre game lately. Art direction is boring ""melting"" locales that AI could generate, terrible out of place music that really wants to be Nier:Automata score ( but with random instruments and genre changes that match nothing in game ). Combat is just a rythimc game, no strategy needed - but still you will have to grind since bosses are damge sponges to force you to grind. 

Its popularity and almost unviersal acclaim as game of the year is crazy, akin to mass histeria.

1903340,"[For Those Who Come After]

It's a good game with a mysterious world and a compelling story that keeps you invested. However, I do wish they would of considered putting some quality of life features into the game that tracked sidequests and a minimap to help with exploration. Having a minimap with ""fog of war"" (only seeing what you've explored) would have been immensely helpful in my journey preventing me from running around in circles. Expedition 33 is a straight forward turn-based RPG game that relies heavily on passive abilities you obtain from ""pictos"" which is essentially your gear in any other RPG. You're gonna want to master every pictos you pick up as it allows for your entire party to use the passive abilities from these pictos without equipping them. These passive abilities you obtain is how you are going to optimize your builds along with skills and weapon perks. This results in ""struggle builds"" in the early game where it can be difficult to get an optimize build going because you have to constantly swap out pictos to master. As you progress further into the game, this will become less of a hassle.

I would call it a ""turn-based lite"" as the real-time mechanics requires the skill of dodging, jumping, parrying, and QTEs to survive encounters with not much tactical or strategical depth required to overcome most of its challenges. There is no item management in this game -- you have panacea-like potions that just cures all status effects without worrying about having antidotes, eye drops, phoenix downs, and the likes. Also, there is no positioning in this game -- no moving your party in the front or back to increase parry windows or attacks. Skills cost action points instead of MP, and can regenerate rather quickly with the right passive abilities which encourages more aggressive play. . With that said, this is a more welcoming and accessible turn-based RPG game for players who struggle to overcome the complexities and strategical nuances that most turn-based games have to offer.

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a HIGH Recommendation.

First I wasn't sure if I should play it as I honestly suck at games with counter mechanics, but after watching the first 30 min of gameplay at my favorite streamer and ended up crying like a little kid I new I had to play it myself.

The world, graphics, combat, voice actors and story-telling are all amazing, the characters beautifully written.

I even ended up liking the combat system which I initially feared, quickly getting better at dodging and parrying, but I think most fights should be doable even if you can't avoid attacks well. 
It works well with keyboard or controller, the turn based system making strategic fighting possible. 
The developers also included a story mode option which makes the fights a bit easier.

1903340,"Okay, so, I've bought this game a while ago, after huge praise it got from everyone or rather after the hate it got from publications that were praising literal garbage and hating on this. What ever those people don't like might actually be superb.

Well after hearing the Soundtrack on my Steam Deck and trying it out there for the first time. 
(That device is a true backlog murder machine.)
I've decided to try it out on the big screen with more then 40 FPS (It is really not optimized well even on a 9070XT)
And yeah, I came across the usual UE5 things, like blurry shadows, pop-ins, poor performance, reliance on AI fake optimization and so on.

I then did the first tutorial fight an remembered people saying: ""I can never do a normal turn based combat game ever again"". And rolled my eyes, sure, having QTEs spices up the combat, but it is not THAT important. ""I will see what comes next"", I thought to myself. 
But beating the mime at the harbor on the hardest difficulty only with skill rather then by over-leveling is quite something though, I have to admit. It is not easy to put skill impression into turn based combat, they managed it. 
""Well, this might not be that bad after-all.""

After wandering around the city for 30 minutes and watching the true intro to this game I came here to make this review.
Getting a tear out of someone after just that short amount of time is not easy. 
Although I have to admit that I am too in my 30s now and imagining that this could be the last thing that I ever do, my last journey after losing my wife, it hit home very strong. 
What is there to hope for when facing a god like being that just wiped out thousands of people without even moving?

Well, I'll see!",True,1761468620,85,174
1903340,"[h2] A great game [/h2]
The story is the main (not only though) selling point, it is as interesting as it is sad. If I say more, I would be soiling it for you. I'll only say there is a lot of loss, followed by grief.
The music needs an award. Go listen to it. 
My only problem are the graphics - Unreal engine sometimes makes things look blurry or causes (out of combat) frame loss.
The gameplay is good, if you like parrying (there is an easy mode to extend the margin of error) and/ or big numbers after buildcrafting. Exploration is often rewarded and the overworld opens up as you progress. The main path is mostly linear, but you can come back to any side areas sooner or later. If you are struggling with one, you'll be able to return there stronger, no grind needed.

1903340,"Everything you've heard about this game is accurate  - it really is that amazing from beginning to end. That's not to say it has zero flaws, as I definitely think the final portions of the game are a bit oddly paced. There's some improvement that can also be made towards organizing your slots and abilities that you put into them for each character. Also could've used a map within each zone, but that's a me thing as I get lost very easily and some areas were a bit difficult to navigate. Nothing I'm mentioning though takes away from the GOTY it is. I believe it'll be considered classic 20 years from now. I was also one of those people that would catch playthroughs on YT here and there and was skeptical about the hype, to be honest. It's just one of those games that you need to play yourself. And don't let the turn-based element completely turn you off, because it's not the way it's typically handled in other games. You do take your turn to attack/buff/etc, but you still have to be on alert when the enemy or boss decides to try to hit you 5 times in a row and you need to either dodge or parry. I'm terrible at both and would rage, but it usually felt like I could win a battle if I tried hard and readjusted stuff. I liked that I didn't really feel like I had to grind to proceed. Having said that, it's worth looking around because it's a beautiful world, with killer music and some incredible moments with some really amazing characters. For the first time in a long time, I felt really excited to play each time even after dying 5 billion times to the same boss. I didn't look up anything because I just wanted to play it for however long I felt like it. It was refreshing.

1903340,"Clair Obscur is an okay game. 
The story's solid, though it sometimes feels like it needs more time to breathe.
The music is outrageously good, especially lategame, and the voice acting and spectacle are very well executed.

However, the extremely player power-sided balancing and reliance on dodging/parrying elaborate attack strings makes for very unsatisfying JRPG gameplay where you're either hyperoptimizing to cheese things and thus negating the action side of the game or playing more 'legit' and neglecting the RPG elements.
The game has a very weird difficulty curve thanks to this, assuming you're making use of everything it gives you - it starts out okay and quickly degenerates into a damage stacking festival.

There's also a general lack of polish in some areas, like getting stuck on rocks while walking around or clipping through the floor, or the fact that the campsite always looks pretty much the exact same regardless of where you camp.

Also to be real this game is an absolute masterpiece. Easy 10/10. The risks this game and it's daring story takes pay off immensely and really capture the essence of what it is to be human and feel things so very deeply. Its got a great blend of RPG and action mechanics that mesh nearly perfectly, the French cinema influence is so real in the best ways, the characters are incredibly gripping and beautifully crafted and full of so many different layers (for better and for worse), and just. The presentation and the art direction and the pacing and the boss battles and the intertwined mechanics are all so great and just AHHH I could talk for hours tbh.

And THE MUSIC. Dear Gods the music is incredible. The sound design in general is perfect (special shout out to the sound that plays when someone achieves a Break) but MANNN Lorien Testard deserves all the accolades in the world for just how incredible the music is, there's such a wide range of tracks that all perfectly fit their moments and encounters and have so much mastery in their construction on offer here. 

Even with a few minor issues and technical hiccups and a bit of jank (and a few minigames that will forever bring me rage to think on) it's never enough to truly detract from what was truly a classic in the making. For something so well crafted to be Sandfall's first project, that everyone pulled their weight SO much, it's truly an accomplishment.

I loved almost everything about this game.

Music:
The soundtrack is phenomenal. It‚Äôs up there with my all-time favorites like Xenoblade Chronicles, Nier Automata, and Final Fantasy X. Expedition 33 has one of the best soundtracks I‚Äôve heard in years‚Äîit really sets the tone and elevates the experience.

Combat:
The combat is a fantastic mix of turn-based mechanics with quick-time events, active parrying, and dodging. As a fan of turn-based combat, I see this as an evolution of the genre. It feels dynamic and engaging. I wasn‚Äôt the biggest fan of the quick-time events for certain abilities, but luckily, you can turn them off if you prefer. No complaints there.

Characters:
The cast is absolutely funtastic! Each character is well-developed, and their interactions feel natural and meaningful. The conversations are mature and thought-provoking, making you genuinely care about their journey.

Story:
While I didn‚Äôt love the story, I still really enjoyed it. Act 1 had me completely hooked‚Äîit was compelling and mysterious. However, after that, things became a bit convoluted, and my interest waned slightly. That said, the character moments throughout kept me engaged, and there are still some great twists and turns. For me, Act 1 was fantastic, but the narrative lost a bit of steam after that.

Final Thoughts:
Despite some minor narrative hiccups, Expedition 33 is easily one of the best games I‚Äôve played in years. It‚Äôs definitely my game of the year so far, and I can‚Äôt recommend it enough.

1903340,"[h2]Confidence counts for a lot... but not everything[/h2]
This is one of those titles that I appreciate more than I actually enjoy.

Expedition 33 starts off as strong as any RPG I can think of. The opening hours introduce a world and characters that are instantly captivating, and you'll be totally on board and invested in the story by the time you see the title drop. It's bold and confident in a way that's great to see from an indie studio.

Combat is where we run into the first hitch. I played through the entire game on Expert, because I'm a diehard fan of games like Sekiro and Nine Sols, parry-based defense systems with fast enemy attack patterns. Unfortunately, COE33 mostly reinforces my love of those games by demonstrating what it's like when the gameplay *isn't* tuned to perfection.

Parry windows are insanely tight, but worse, they're inconsistent. Some attacks hit on a sound cue, others when the animation collides with your model, others [i]before[/i] the animation collides, and some even [i]after[/i] it, to the point where the parries sometimes have very little to do with the visual attack. Even worse, the camera often puts other party members in the way, or zooms out to a ridiculous degree that makes accurate timing nearly impossible. Enemies love to drag out and delay their swings like they're Margit in molasses, but because it's turn-based you can't do anything to punish them for it. Every attack is unique, sometimes even from the same enemy, which makes combat a neverending process of trial and error.

In better parry systems, you can improve your core skill at the mechanic enough to take on new enemies and do well--but here, the first time you run into anything new, you're almost guaranteed to have a few party wipes until you memorize their attack patterns and no-hit them. The coup de gr√¢ce is the damage balancing. Up until the last 15 hours or so, I never had access to gear (""Pictos"") with good enough defensive stats to prevent even trash mobs from one-shotting most of my party members. This means that a single mistake costs you a turn and a revive--par for the course in JRPGs, but absolutely brutal when skipping a turn means having to sit through another attack string from the enemies, some of which can have nearly a dozen hits in them.

Don't play this on Expert.

All that misery was mostly self-inflicted; but a bigger issue is the story. It's nearly impossible to discuss without spoilers, but the plot plays its cards pretty early regarding some of its foundational mysteries... and I couldn't believe they were actually doing it. It felt like watching someone load up a bunch of foreshadowing shotgun shells, pump the gun, point it squarely down, and blow their own foot off.

After that, the narrative stakes are gone and remain utterly impossible to recover. The final act of the game tries to rebuild tension, but it just feels completely deflated. I was shaking my head and going ""who cares?"" during most of the late cutscenes. The actual ending was fine, and thematically appropriate, but left me completely apathetic.

Art and sound are also worth discussing: the visual design is definitely a matter of taste, but personally I didn't care for the look of the world at all after leaving the initial city. It's going for a ""painterly"" aesthetic, but to me most areas and enemies felt like messy blobs of melting goo. The clashing biomes and stark colors are clearly intentional choices, I just don't think they worked.

The soundtrack, however, constantly astounds with a variety of excellent instrumental, electronic, and choral tracks that blend together in a somehow cohesive whole. Genuinely the highlight of the game. The vocal performances (I played in English) and cutscene motion capture were also excellent across the board.

Now, given the wildly negative review, do I think you should play this? I've gone back and forth on whether this is a recommend or not. Frankly, despite its many, many flaws, it's the kind of game I want to see more of. Ambitious, mature, innovative, and made with clear passion, I'm glad it's seen so much critical success and gotten so much buzz. I just didn't have a very good time [i]playing[/i] the actual thing. But if nothing in this review is a total dealbreaker for you, then I do think it's worth seeing for yourself whether or not you like it.",True,1761365389,2910,24

[spoiler] changing the main character halfway through the story did not help, forcing us to play Verso, a character we barely knew right after Gustave was a poor move. Yes, Verso's story is both tragic and integral to the plot but forcing us to play him felt a bit off [/spoiler]

The reason you should play CO33 is because it's going to be unlike anything you've ever played in the best way possible. It has its influences, sure. But the composition of the entire game is so original and artistically authentic that it stands out in a league of its own. Even if you're not thrilled by the concept of a turn-based JRPG, you'll learn to love it if you approach it with an open mind. 

I can say after completion that almost nothing I have ever played comes close to this. It is a true artistic masterpiece, crafted with lots of attention to detail and a concern for the player's enjoyment. Yes, these developers set out to make sure you enjoyed this game. It's not packed with bloated features or irrelevant side quests to get you to keep playing.  And for that reason, they deserve all the praise - and money - in the world.",True,1761361559,3891,1

1903340,"[h1] What is Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 [/h1]
Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a culmination of both passion and dedication carefully mixed together with a sprinkle of luck, the kind of luck of catching a lightning in a bottle honestly, a pretty well working miracle ensembled in a way that manages to deliver a really solid experience with its pure heart rather than relying on hyper technical industry bending accomplishments funded by multi millionaire studios combined together to bring you the last marvels of technology and seasonal rewards. Hereafter I will discuss about some aspects that the game delivered for me and many others under here as the most beautiful parts of its whole package, such as:

[list]
[*] Story
[*] Gameplay
[*] Soundtrack
[*] Graphics/Art Direction
[/list]

[b] - Story - [/b]
The looming number in the sky is the same number you see in the title of the game (hells yeah), and, let's say...it's a very central part of the narrative; and that's as far as I am willing to share about it. How profound of you, you might exclaim...but seriously, I'm on a trampoline here...the writing of the story and the main characters inside Expedition 33 story are so well thought out that it needs to be experienced rather than being told for how fresh as a take it is, how striking and impactful it is and how mature it presents itself to the public. The dubbing adds so much more life and colour to what already was an intricate entanglement of plots and characters that it's almost embarrassing for higher end studios to not have this kind of will or care for the craft (let's just tease you by saying that Andy Serkis has a big role in here). The main point here is that E33 doesn't shy away whatsoever from depressing and grounded topics that could easily identify and define any of us playing the game; some relatable experiences that are touched upon in here are just as mundane and heart-breaking as we can experience as human beings in our daily routines, and yet it's also generous in giving you some relief from the cruelties and the inevitabilities of life.

[b] - Gameplay - [/b]
It took us 26 years to witness another RPG implement a sort of Quick Time Event skill based system after The Legend of Dragoon (funded, published and abandoned by Sony back in 1999/2001) and It took us another 18 years to witness a compelling and mature story being part of a turn-based RPG as it was in Lost Odyssey as well (FFX back in 2001 was also already pretty mature as a videogame, and the first Final Fantasy with dubbed characters, yet FF titles are generally received as more light-hearted novels) back in 2007. So now we have this behemoth of a Je'RPG (yes you read it right) redefining the mechanics and pretty much giving a fresh coat of depth that we, as RPG/JRPG fans, didn't even knew we wanted, giving us such a vast degree of freedom in creating classes and builds that, for the genre, I think it will go unmatched for quite some time. Did I already mentioned that you can potentially parry or dodge EVERY attack that  ANY enemy throws at you? Yeah, well, now I did. So, not only it gives you an insurmountable amount of content for party members to experiment with and passive points that let you create synergies between your weapons and your skills, but it also tells you that, if you ""git gud"", you can overcome every difficulty! (except maybe one fuckin fuck of a fucker eh-eeeeeh boi).

[b] - Soundtrack - [/b]
The score in CO:E33 is just as fitting as you can imagine for the living people of the french nation, with a couple of headbangers mixed inside a mostly orchestral soundtrack that (sadly) features a lot of french lyrics (CAN YOU BELIEVE THE GUTS ON THEM FOR DOING SO?). As I've seen in a video covering the development of the game, the composer was at his first project, not even specifying if big or small, just [u]literally[/u] his first work ever on a videogame or production of some sort, casually dropping a career defining collection of musical pieces, and that's insane. Yeah...I really don't know what to say no more, so here's a bunch of french words to sooth your mind: [i]baguette, croissant, mon coeur, sacre bleu, tour de france, parfum, pomme de terre[/i] (and so MANY more, don't get me started).

[b] - Graphics/Art Direction - [/b]
As far as I'm concerned, the visuals of this game are my only gripe, because they both look very impressive...but also very terrible. The lighting in the environment is managed pretty badly most of the times, but it makes a full 360¬∞ twist when switching to a cutscene or while having a close up dialogue, giving you a sense of inspiration being taken from the 40's well acquainted tasteful classy romantic voulez vous coucher avec moi french movie in an instant. It has got brilliant cutscenes and facial expressions, the enemies and inhabitants of the world that are not human-shaped are peculiar to say the least, but also very charming (Esquie is a brilliant example of this), and I kinda love it because it doesn't remind me of anything in particular and it feels like it was purposely painted for this game. The world building is generous and fulfilling without going on forever, which is a plus for me, presenting a decent variety between scenarios.

[h2] It is pretty [i] Clair [/i] that this Expedition is [i] Obscur...33.[/i] [/h2]
Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a complete work of art that checks a lot of boxes for me, made by a dedicated production of very well passionate individuals making the most of their experience, and it's a remarkable achievement for me personally to look at this game, to think that it's actually holding up despite the limitations it had and the fierce competition that could have easily outshined this project if it was more focused on making games for the fun of it instead of being led by petty monetary gain. In the end, the good aspects completely nullify some technical and graphical artifacts that the Unreal Engine 5 managed to bring over. 

With that said,
I'm giving Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 
10 very soft and fluffy on the inside but 
solid and crunchy on the outside freshly baked baguettes out of 10.
(which is the highest possible rating in France)
Enjoy while it's fresh!

Come on, I finished 100% of the game but still I did not find a good competition to KCD2, though I can agree that Clar Obscur: Expedition 33 is superior in artwork (it basicallly has more artistic freedom plotwise) but the game pales in comparison in other art directions, i.e. cinematography.

In conclusion, I expected WAY more from this based on all the talks but putting it all aside I definitely enjoyed it for what it offers, I even 100%-ed it! Though not GOTY but it represents jrpg genre very well

System recommendations. 
Ran it on R5 7600x 16gb ddr5 RTX3080ti and sata ssd. I still used DLSS a little (like 75% was raw raster) because 1 location (""Stone Wave Cliffs"" I believe) was running with low FPS (felt like a bit under 30). But otherwise there was no complaint for a 100% run",True,1761317518,7032,1

1903340,"(Minor Spoilers)

It takes a really special piece of media for me to listen/watch/play for an extended period of time. 
I can never find myself enjoying sitting down and consuming a single piece of media for too long. 
I don't really know how I got to this point, maybe I have addled my brain with too much time spent watching short form content that my attention span has been reduced to nothing. 
Maybe it's that I am getting older and have less time after work to indulge in such pleasures.

For example I play a match of War Thunder, die within 1 minute into the match, I still have reserve vehicles which I can continue playing but I find myself just ALT+F4'ing and going onto another game.
Conversely I could have just finished a 40-60 minute DotA 2 match, clawing our way back from near defeat all the way to assured victory and destroying the enemy team, so even though I would be riding that sweet dopamine ride of victory I very rarely would think to myself and say ""Yes, another""
Instead I'll quit and move onto the next game.
Play for a bit and either get bored or frustrated.
Then move on to the next game.
Rinse and repeat.
Even when I play with friends I find the longer I play a game with them the more I start to want to play another game, and that makes the current game feel like it is dragging me down
I know that sounds dumb, but I guess that is just how my brain works.

Which means (for me at least) any media that makes me  WANT to play longer is truly special in my eyes.

And that is the case with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33

There was a lot of talk about how good this game was since launch, how critics are claiming this is a GOTY contender from the very moment it burst onto the market.
And in an era of AAA publishers pushing half baked bug infested games to market and fixing them after launch, Clair Obscur was a breath of fresh air.
Now, I am by no means a critic, I leave such detailed analysis to my brother who is far more experienced in delving into the intricacies of what separates the good media to consume from the bad.
He quite often recommends pieces of media he thinks I would enjoy, and despite how stubborn I can be to listen to him, he is right 99% of the time.

My brother didn't need to convince me to play Clair Obscur.

There were many things that drew me into wanting to play this game.
The social media hype.
The critical acclaim.
The art design.
The gameplay.
The fact I got a new PC and wanted it to flex its muscle on games at ultra quality at 1440p.

But what actually did it for me is that I'm a sucker for sound tracks.


I don't know how Sandfall Interactive did it but they managed to get a composer who has never done work on Video games before and say ""fuck it"" and produce 150+ tracks for this game.

All of them are great tracks
Some are even amazing tracks
A few are absolutely certified BANGERS.
A truly astonishing feat for a western game and Lorien Testard should receive all the praise he deserves.

Which coming from a Kiwi is saying something (IYKYK).

The sound track along with the performances from the voice actors made me find myself constantly and consistently getting shivers right as the moment hits during the cut scene.
Two in particular, Lumi√®re and Une vie √† t'aimer shine out.

Lumi√®re being what in my eyes (or ears in this case) is the Leitmotif for the whole game.
The constant call backs and subtle changes to it you hear throughout the game make this piece a central part to the story, and the main track by itself is just an actual masterpiece.
Alice Duport-Percier's voice is immaculate and I now constantly find myself humming ""dim dim dah da di dim dim dah"" all the time now as a result.

But then there is Une vie √† t'aimer.
When it comes to video game music, there is a certain song from a certain JRPG that is universally praised by all.
So when people call this song the French One Winged Angel it just shows you how fucking hard this song goes.
THIS is how you make music for boss fights, I can't remember the last time playing a game and just completely enthralled the music. 
A song that has both a male and female vocalist absolutely going at it is a perfect metaphor for the game, which if you know the story you would realise how seriously poetic this along with the other vocalised soundtracks are.

The sound track is just *chefs kiss* overall, and if it doesn't win best sound track of the year somebody needs to see what kind of drugs Geoff Keighley is taking.

Now finally the game play.
I am still not sure if Clair Obscur is technically a JRPG, but whatever it is, it is basically the western equivalent of it.
Either way I am no stranger to JRPG's and souls like games, I have been a fan of Pokemon since I was 7, and I have begrudgingly played through the Dark Souls trilogy and still have my sanity, although souls-like games aren't my go to style of game, I am definitely not opposed to them.

But playing this game just hits different.

Each playable character's play style is so unique, and trying to find those perfect synergies with each other was really fun to finally hone in on, and then satisfying to watch as you pummel the enemies into oblivion.
Their move sets are flashy, are great to watch, and the quick time events to use the moves keeps you just as engaged using the moves as you are when trying to dodge the enemies moves.

Overall game design and world building figuratively (and literally) a work of art, no two game levels ever feel the same and it was fun to explore them fully and finding those little secret areas of the level that gave rewards via lore drops or new items.

The world map is fun to navigate, I like seeing inaccessible parts in beginning areas as that gets you back tracking once you progress further in the story to find those hidden goodies that were tantalisingly out of reach just before.

The game loop is fresh, there are a wide range of enemies that all have unique move sets, and that feeling of facing the unknown when it comes to a new enemy happens fairly often, not knowing the timings on the dodges can be real nerve racking to get down right and frustrating when you don‚Äôt (in a good way).

There were always those mini bosses you can face, special ‚Äúchroma‚Äù versions of enemies you can find that are far tougher to beat, they often expand on the regular version‚Äôs move sets which can catch you out, especially if you aren‚Äôt expecting a 4th or 5th hit in what is normally a 3 hit combo for the standard version of the enemy.


The main group of characters each have their charm and touching backstory that really makes you invested in their outcome. 
Playing through the Prologue you really understand what they are all fighting for, each year everyone of a certain age effectively gets Thanos snapped, and your expedition, so full of hope, is determined to put an end to it.
Which seeing what happens at the start and end of Act 1 a real fucking heart breaker.
The expedition starts off landing right into an ambush and all but the playable characters survive.
And then at the end of act 1, you have who you think is the main character just get fucking OWNED.
In fact the ending cut scenes of both act 1 and act 2 left me lost for words.
Both story events that happened really turned everything I thought I knew about the story and how I thought it was going to play out in its head.


It really showed that this game was gonna take you for a ride emotionally (in a good way) and made me really invested in the story to see what came next.

I do hope they make a sequel, or at the very least a DLC.
I still haven‚Äôt fully finished the game, just the main story.

So I am looking forward to jumping back in to see what parts I missed, and more importantly see how much damage I can get Maelle to do.

1903340,"Overall great game - the main selling points of the game are the great story/visuals/OST, and the combat. From a story perspective, it gave me vibes of Nier Automata (I enjoyed Expedition 33 more). From a gameplay perspective, this is like Paper Mario or Super Mario RPG with the turn-based/active combat system.

+ Great music, great visuals, great story, and great characters.
+ I like how the full team can be used (if your main team dies in combat, you can bring in the remaining members to win the fight)
+ Item usage is good, refreshes at checkpoints so no need to stockpile healing items throughout the playthrough.
+ Stable, no real crashes.
+ All characters feel balanced in combat, and I enjoyed playing and leveling everyone up throughout my playthroughs.

- The pacing near the end of the game (around final Act) is confusing. I suggest once you get to this Act where everything opens up, you should resist the urge to do all optional content before facing the final boss and just go straight to the boss. You can go back and complete the side content afterwards without any issue.
- The relationship system breaks me out of immersion a bit - I wish it just naturally happened instead of being something you opt into.",True,1761267133,5326,11

1903340,"This game is artistically beautiful, between the music, visuals, and cutscenes, it's easy to see why people can be so captivated with its presentation.  I've seen many people calling this game a masterpiece, and it's a little hard to argue otherwise!  The positives certainly outweigh the negatives, but I don't think that means this game is without fault, either.

One thing I will mention is that I think that while the level design is beautiful, it is also kind of a hassle to navigate.  Every area has *dozens* of dead-ends with loot to be found or mini-bosses to fight, most of which aren't too important.  But then sometimes you'll miss Energizing Start 2, find Energizing Start 3 later, and realize you missed an incredibly important staple item and have to go backtrack to get it.  You might have scenarios like this happen to you multiple times throughout the game.  It's annoying!

That aside, the RPG combat might be what I'm *most* conflicted by.  I played this game on Expert up until the final boss of Act 2, where I finally got tired of this game's reliance on parry mechanics.  This game really showcases the negatives of the ""parrification"" of modern games where attacks are intentionally designed to be misleading, just to increase the difficulty of parrying successfully.

I *love* how unique each character is, and there is a lot of customization available for each character and how you want to play them.  However, since parrying is what generates the most AP, the flow of the game is greatly hampered if you aren't parrying most attacks that come your way.  To the game's defense, there *are* ways to generate more AP by simply face-tanking everything, but Expert mode's damage is so high that it's very difficult to get to that point.  Overall I found the gameplay to be the weakest part of this game, and it's entirely due to the enemy design.

The story is pretty good and has a good amount of depth, and I think the primary antagonist is incredibly well written.  I won't go into much detail about Acts 1 and 2, but the game is able to flip between charming and funny moments while maintaining a constant undertone of melancholy.  Going full into Act 3 spoilers, but [spoiler] the ending left me feeling conflicted, and I think the reason stems from the decision to let the player choose between two endings.

This is a deeply personal story of the grief of Verso's family, and it feels very weird that you, the player, who had no input in the story up until this point, make a binary choice to decide their fate.  Either Maelle stays in her fictional painted world, or Verso is finally put to rest, allowing the family to come together again to grieve.  

I dislike the decision to force a final fight between these two because of what it means for the one you *didn't* choose.  Either Verso is effectively a prisoner to Maelle who cannot let go of the past, or Verso pushes Maelle away without convincing her to finally let go. Both options feel like a poor resolution for the other party, and I would have preferred a single ending where the two can come together and accept whatever the final outcome is. [/spoiler]

I think this is absolutely a game worth giving a play, and I'm glad to have finished it.",True,1761265982,2506,15

This is the work of art and not a game, the audio, the visuals, the combat system, everything is so satisfying and the volume of tears I have produced have probably made me dehydrated. 11/10.

1903340,"What a game! - A truly fantastic and unique story, as it unfolds so does combat mechanics with easy to learn hard to master with the twist of the player itself being responsible for the dodge, which creates a more interactive game, as well as giving the player more agency (where mistakes are on you - no some chance procentage) - and I love it. 

I think most can quickly recognize this game as being quite beatiful with its very artistic style (with the only major downside here being that it was made with UE5), however, I think the characters themselves shouldn't be overlooked either - as they each have their values and goals explored throughtout the story - also in a quite natural way.

The soundtrack is rarely something I focus on with games - unless of course it is a rythem game, but I have quite a few songs from this game now saved to my spotify playlist.


Conclusion:
These 3 pillars are what in my opinion can make this the game of year. 

On another note, I also quite admire that none of the achievements have less than 10%, this could possibly be statistical evidence to suggest that most people truly enjoyed this game - as some of these are from relatively hard optionel boss fights.

A few negatives:
- some of the gestral games (mini-games) are a bit janky and feels quite unpolished compared to the main game
- UE5 with regard to performance and presentation of the game itself... 
- A playable character(V) later in the game, with a central role in the story feels quite boring compared to the others.

A few additional positves:
- the equipment system and pictos were a bit of a mystery for me at the beginning... but I figured it out somewhere along the way - and quite like it as well
- Every character is unique in their fighting style, but can also be a bit overwhelming... I must admit it was first later in the game that I wanted to try and understand one of the companions fighting style.... But this is a postive as it adds variety to the gameplay",True,1761257006,5124,8

The story will keep you in the dark for 90% of the playthrough. Which in my opinion is a poor flaw in the writing. You won't understand what is happening until 15 hours into the game. They give small hints, here and there, but nothing that will allow you to understand the overall grandiose plot. Once, the plot is finally revealed, everything instantly becomes better and more enjoyable. It just a shame that it takes so long to understand. 

Personally, the game was a struggle to continue forward with and I would have stopped if it wasn't for the hype that surrounded it. The combat system of turn-based isn't my favorite. Although they did make it interesting with it's complexity, that I honestly, didn't fully understand.

There is so much love and time that was put into Clair Obscur, and it shows that the gaming industry isn't dead.

By far the best part of this game are the characters, the game just makees you really care for them and you yourself want to see them succeed. They all are just amazing and honestly I wish they did more stuff with em! Lune Sciel lose plot relevence after about halfway through act 2 and Monoco doesn't really have much stuff do to overall. Fortunately the side quests and camp interactions help it a bit but I really wish they had more plot relevence beacuse as I said after beating about 60% of the game the main plot focuses on Maelle and Verso (which is done amazingly for the record). The story overall is SO fucking good like bro ah it makes you think about it for days but I don't want to spoil you too much. I really loved finding the journals of previous expeditions and their flags, just learning what our predecesors did is really nice. Unfortunately the game fails a bit in this regard, the enviornmental story telling would have been A LOT better imo if the bodies we find would have the corresponding numbers on their bands. They do have em in cutscenes but normally they're just empty so every body we find looks about the same, it's not much of an issue really but would have been an amazing detail. Another great thing is the combat, I've played many jrpgs over the years and this game probably has one of the best there is, just, amazing and satysfying. Honestly thank God this game is turnbased beacuse the hitboxes are terrible LMAO. What does that mean? Well basically in the overworld you can find nooks and crannies which you think you can enter but oops invisible wall, you have an attack to get an advantage in fights but it's hitboxes are ASS, it's hitboxes is about 2/3 of the size of the attacks animation and the parkour. Oh God the parkour. There aren't many parkouring segments so it's not really that big of a deal but the grabbing ledges mechanic doesn't work correctly I think (especially during exploration). You often have to walk around to get somewhere even tho in theory your character should be able to grab the ledge, it often gets a bit frustrating when you find those Gestral challanges where you have to pray the character will grab onto the ledge and not bounce off of it. Jumping isn't good overall beacuse you lose control of your character mid air and after you hit the ground your character does a roll which you can't stop, you can turn mid air to affect the way where your character will go aftere dropping but it's pretty janky. The music tho guys the music is SOOOO GEWS MMMM. I forgot to talk about the locations, they're awesome! The setting is really cool and what happens in it is just so... Magical. Sorry if this review seems too negative, I really love this game and it's just almost perfect, the gestral challanges aren't even that hard for the record and there's not much platforming in this game so it's not really an issue but when it is it's not good.

If you want a solid combat system, here you go. Good story? I cried within the first hour, and felt things no other game has made me feel in a bit. Music? The sheer amount of tracks and differences between variations of each song is astounding. Graphics? Do you see the cover art? the game pretty much looks that good the whole way through. There's not a single place I've looked that made me think ""that could've been a little more detailed..""

I could (and have) rant about this game for hours on end, I don't even write reviews and here I am writing one for this game because it truly deserves every bit of praise it gets.

And finally, is it perfect? No, nothing is. Is it worth your hard earned money? Yes, yes it is. Do you need to be good at games to enjoy it? No, there's a story mode difficulty for people who don't want to pull their hair out!

1903340,"Pretty good game overall. Really liked the story, and the combat is very active and fun for a turn-based game. Very pretty with awesome music. Very little to complain about.

The difficulty was a little weird for me. First off - when it tells you that mastering Parry/Dodge is helpful but not mandatory for normal difficulty, they are absolutely lying. If you don't hit the majority of your parries, you will die. A lot. It is doable, but I found it tedious. So I ended up dropping it down to easy, but that was way too easy. Damage dropped down to about 1/10 what I was taking in normal, every semblance of challenge was gone. I'll take a too easy game over too hard / tedious, but I really would have liked a setting in between the two.

Also Act 3. I did what it told me to do, and the game ended. Took like an hour or two. Maybe there's a bunch of optional stuff out there that didn't really get hinted at, but as far as mandatory content it could've just been stuck at the end of Act 2.",True,1761192734,1409,128

There‚Äôs a ton of endgame content and even a New Game+ mode to keep you hooked. The story captures the spirit of classic JRPGs with some truly amazing plot twists; some you might see coming, and others that will completely catch you off guard.

The characters are all lovable and funny, supported by some of the best voice acting I‚Äôve ever heard in a game. The animations are impressively lifelike and fluid, avoiding the stiffness that npcs have in so many titles.

On Steam it has an ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" rating, the highest possible and I have to say that the game more than lives up to that rating.

If you love a character-driven story with emotion and heart, this game dives deeply into complex characters and their evolving relationships.  Twists and turns in the story carry emotional weight of heroism and heartache.

The composition of the music is exceptional and deeply emotionally moving using classical instruments and sonorous female vocals.  The artist is exceptional with the wonderfully vivid imaginations of the developers bringing the world to life in and wondrously immersive way.

If you havent played it, play it.

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a game that has been rightly hyped up.  Not only is the game beautiful, not only is the game play fast paced and frenetic while also having deep tactics, and not only does the game have one of the most amazing soundtracks of the decade, it also has a story that is far deeper and emotionally evocative than you could believe.

Clair Obscur is a game that is difficult to talk about, because there's almost nothing to say that won't spoil moments from the story that are worth experiencing for yourself.  To put things simply, this is a masterpiece of a game.  It's fun, it looks amazing, it sounds amazing, it's written fantastically, it manages to have the proper amount of tonal shifts to keep you engaged and not make you numb to the story beats, and the game is going to ask you to make decisions that don't have perfect outcomes.

The only thing that this game has issues with is the ultimate boss you can choose to fight, that is so difficult compared the rest of the game that it essentially requires you to create a kind of cheat build to accomplish.  I just recommend avoiding it, because it doesn't add anything of value to the story.

In addition, I recommend that you complete the game prior to doing optional side content, as the game is really set up with this expectation in mind.  I completed the game after doing all the side content, and it was so easy that even after setting the final boss to 100X health, turning off healing, and getting rid of some of my better abilities, the final boss was too easy.  So, do that before you do the side content to get the best end game experience",True,1761162915,3329,135

The visual design is stunning ‚Äî a world painted in light and shadow, beauty and sorrow. The combat is a dance of creativity and control, with each character offering build possibilities that invite experimentation.

The bosses ‚Äî each one a spectacle of art and challenge, unforgettable encounters that demand not only skill but understanding. However the difficulty curve is a little funky. Every now and then you run into some really hard enemies but you scale kinda fast and at a certain point you can just one shot everything.

And the music is phenomenal, perfectly complementing every emotional beat, boss fight and tranquil moment. It's a love letter to both players and game composers. At times, it doesn‚Äôt even feel like a game ‚Äî it feels like a living musical, where every step and every sound are part of the same grand performance.

This is more than a game. It's an experience. A great adventure.

great story, good fighting, masterful visuals and music.

Cons:
- I often found myself spending hours getting lost and not being able to find the objective.
- with there being so many enemies on the maps, combat encounters can easily get a bit stale towards the end of the game.

It isn't just turn based, though; you're actively interacting during each animation through parrying, dodging and QTEs. As you learn about each character and the world at large, you feel a genuine connection to each and every one. A story full of loss and grief yet having to push onward in spite of it.

TRULY OF OF THE BEST STORY/LORE/CAMPAIGN OF ANY GAME I HAVE PLAYED

a masterpiece that stands out from the half finished garbage that plagues the industry. 
The story outside of game play was incredibly refreshing.  Plot develops beautifully to a tough and unexpected choice the players are forced to make. Honestly, the story alone is worth playing through the campaign. 

If you like the core game play of a turn based game with real time elements for dodge/parry then you are a fool to not give them your money right now.

Yes this game is that good and this game is a good scale to see if award shows or review sites / videos are legitimate or not.

It is a visually stunning and unique game, the gameplay and systems are unique and the story - at least for the first 2 acts is amazing. More importantly it is fun and has a gravitas behind it which is hard to explain. It had quite a few WOW moments too which is always welcome.

‚Ä¢Opening is insane! Despite only 15 min into the game I got somehow attached to these characters and got me emotional deep inside

‚Ä¢ For those who love turn-based jrpg (to my millennial bros and sis), this game is for us. What makes this even better is the parry and dodge mechanics. There's a real-time defensive mechanics that rewards players when reacting to enemy patterns correctly.

‚Ä¢ Dozens of optional bosses and locations with god like rewards. It doesn't feel repetitive.

‚Ä¢ 10/10 OST!!!!! Especially the Une vie √† t'aimer. Stun locks players on the first few sec. Une vie √† peindre is also good my goodness!!!!

‚Ä¢ In my opinion, the length of this game is just perfect. Not too long but definitely not short.

‚Ä¢ Story- I got a mix reaction for this, Act 1 and Act 2 is awesome but before going to Act 3 that's where I got to say... eh? what the heck is this story. This is stupid! Then after finishing this story. BRAVO! Absolute Cinema!!!! 10/10! Even side stories are great!

And finally, growing up and having a family. Games now just don't hit the same anymore like they used to. Until I play and finish this game. I don't usually do this stuff but I beat this game on PS5.

_____________________________________



I thought this game was overhyped. Then I played it. It is not overhyped. Literally a top 5 game for me and I put about 33 hours into it in a single weekend. I never want it to end.

If you like Paper Mario or Super Mario RPG or Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga combat, where it's turn based with reaction commands and dodging/blocking, you will almost certainly like this. Excellent story, world, dialogue, combat, art style/aesthetics, music. The only issues with this game are tiny little nit picky things here and there. If you just look at the broad strokes this is about as perfect a game as I have ever played.

Log Entry #33

I have wandered through countless worlds, but none have captured my soul quite like Expedition 33. This is not merely a game ‚Äî it‚Äôs a masterpiece of emotion, art, and sound. The story unfolds like a living painting ‚Äî emotional, unpredictable, and deeply human. Every step feels like part of something greater, something meticulously crafted. It‚Äôs easily the greatest game I‚Äôve ever played.

The visual design is nothing short of stunning ‚Äî a world painted in light and shadow, beauty and sorrow. The combat is a dance of creativity and control, with each character offering build possibilities that invite experimentation yet feel perfectly balanced.

And the music ‚Äî my god, the music. By far the most beautiful and intentional soundtracks I‚Äôve ever heard in a game. It doesn‚Äôt just accompany the story ‚Äî it becomes part of it. Every note feels planned, every silence meaningful. At times, it doesn‚Äôt even feel like a game ‚Äî it feels like a living musical, where every step and every sound are part of the same grand performance.

1903340,"Personal GOTY 2025 and so refreshing to see a rly new and unique IP/new story game (srsly game is not short but if the main story was at least ~twice as long it would have been a perfect game).
Also a great example of what AAA games should be (full game in the base game, no cashgrab ""mandatory story/side quest dlcs"" while still offering additional DLCs that u can get to support the devs and honestly I never have anything against additional skins, artwork or soundtrack dlcs)

+ Turn based combat done perfectly (srsly parry, perf parry, evade, jump and gradient counter, just amazing!)
+ Every char has their unique fighting style and skills and this is done soooooo great! I loved it! Its rly amazing as whoever u put in the party u always have 3 chars with very different yet compatible playstyle! (Even tho some might not sit with u at first after a few fights/skill unlocks u will like all chars/styles. I rly like all of them even tho I might pref some more but didn't dislike any of them!)
+ Very nice difficulty (til mid act 1 its 2 easy yes, but gets nicely challenging after it. I legit had parts where I put all 3 or 4-5 out of 6 points into defense lol)
+ Great interesting story (altho personally I didn't like every twist/thing you find out in the world they build). 
+ Great gameplay loop, be it longer story cutscenes, multiple battles before I leave the current area and exploring whatever area I was in (rly trying to find all secrets and beat all enemies found)
+ Great chars (altho kinda dislike some of Gustaves early post tutorial decisions/thoughts)
+ Beautiful map and locations (u can see a lot of love was put into every single corner)
+ Exploring is always rewarded (except if u ignore and enter a ""danger"" zone on the main map 2 early in which case ur f**ck*d) and every corner has something for you to find
+ Nice optional puzzles/fun challenges
+- Decent length (depending on ur skill I'd say 25-30h to finish the main story and yeah playin on easy doesn't count as playing), honestly wish the main story was at least 50h long
+ End game content (kinda feel like end game content is ~40+% of the whole game)
- Game like this should have rly been longer in the way that it had a lot more ""game"" before the finale and before the end game content (I rly wish they expanded the story further and put most of the endgame content into the main story before the finale + they rly had few bigger story points that they could have resolved separately with that). Once I beat the game I kinda lost part of the interest as there was no purpose in doing the end game stuff (yes post end content is mostly rly fun, but some felt like a chore as u needed to lv up to be able to do it without 10h long battles where u must evade almost everything, even tho I rly wanted to beat it all and enjoy the adventure I felt less motivated to do so after seeing the ending). I even was thinking of trying the ""danger"" areas before the finale as I somehow wanted to have the side content done before the finale.
+ Additional skins/hairstyles to find
- Sadly most of the skins/hairstyles are the same across (i.e. u unlock ponytail for Lune which looks exaclty like Maelle's and u will 99% unlock the same ponytail for Ciel later, only difference is the hair color xd). Honestly wouldn't even say this is a con if we had more ""uniquer looking"" skins and hairs to find (even if some or most were still ""shared"" then)

1903340,"The game that first got me into RPGs was the Legend of Dragoon and I was instantly reminded of that combat style when I saw a preview of Expedition 33. Although the combat style is similar, it's definitely not the same as the timing button presses go with abilities in this whereas they went with regular attacks in Legend of Dragoon. My gripe with the timing of this game is that they seem to be random as oppose to going with the movement of the character during the ability cast. The combat is quite a bit more complex with Luminas and the ability to equip more passively and weapon passives that can completely change how a character plays aside from just simply choosing other abilities to use in combat. 

This game feels almost like a blend of a JRPG with dark souls with very frequent boss fights and irregular attack patterns from enemies. 

Frequent boss fights - There are sometimes two or three in a row which I'm not a huge fan of personally. I prefer the more JRPG approach of building up to a boss and having them less frequent. 

Irregular attack patterns - The game has 3 ways to deal with enemy attacks: Parry, dodge and jump. At the beginning of the game, dodging seems pretty useless since it's like a parry but no counter attack but later on you find out there are specific attacks that necessitate a dodge. I'm a huge fan of this variety in button timing for defence. What I don't like is how the timing of the button push is right before the attack and not the timing of when the attack hits you so that throws off my timing every now and then. In addition, enemies sometimes do feign attacks or weird movements so you might parry/dodge unnecessarily, which is fine, but a lot of fights are less about timing skill and more about memorising the attack patterns. Meaning I highly doubt you can play this game in 1 playthrough without getting hit (obviously without a guide too). 

All in all, this is a great game with nice graphics, fantastic music, fun side quests and a great story. It doesn't quite scratch that legend of dragoon itch for me, though I acknowledge it's its own game and should be considered as such. I still highly recommend it for turn-based RPG fans.",True,1761061455,2432,16

1903340,"""Clair Obscur"" is a story that often captivates with its atmosphere and thematic depth. Here's a breakdown:

Plus Points (Strengths):

Atmospheric Storytelling: The story excels in creating a specific mood, often utilizing vivid descriptions and sensory details. This can draw the reader into the world and enhance their emotional connection to the narrative.

Thematic Exploration: ""Clair Obscur"" frequently delves into complex themes such as identity, memory, loss, and the nature of reality. This can provide readers with plenty to contemplate and discuss.

Character Development: The characters are often well-developed, with internal conflicts and growth that resonate with readers. Their relationships and interactions can be a significant draw.

Unique Narrative Structure: The story might employ an unconventional narrative structure, such as flashbacks, multiple perspectives, or fragmented timelines, which can add intrigue and keep the reader engaged.

Symbolism and Imagery: The use of symbolism and evocative imagery enriches the story, providing layers of meaning and encouraging deeper interpretation.

Minus Points (Weaknesses):

Pacing Issues: The story might suffer from pacing problems, with sections that feel slow or drag on, potentially losing the reader's interest.

Vagueness and Ambiguity: While thematic depth is a strength, excessive vagueness can be frustrating. If the story is too abstract or unclear, it may alienate some readers.

Character Flaws: While complex characters are good, if the characters' actions or motivations aren't believable, it can undermine the narrative.

Unresolved Plotlines: The story might leave certain plot threads or questions unanswered, which can be unsatisfying for readers who prefer a sense of closure.

Over-reliance on Style: Sometimes, the focus on style and atmosphere can overshadow the plot or character development, leaving the story feeling superficial.",True,1761006901,4446,71

1903340,"This game is seriously beautiful. The art is wild and nothing like most games out there. It feels surreal, like you‚Äôre walking through a dream that makes no sense but somehow keeps pulling you in. Honestly, it‚Äôs both amazing and a little messed up. I kept thinking whoever made this world must‚Äôve been in a strange headspace.

The world itself is huge and gorgeous, but I got lost constantly. I walked in circles more times than I can count/remember. This game needs a mini-map or at least something to help guide you. Half the time I had no clue where I was going, but somehow I still found the next area LOL.

The story starts off super depressing, so if you‚Äôre already feeling down, maybe wait to play this one. It does get better later, but it stays pretty gloomy all the way through. Certainly not my type.

Some bosses and elite enemies are insanely tough, but if you enjoy challenges... you'll love it. It actually feels rewarding when you finally beat them. There are so many skills and Pictons to pick from. It‚Äôs a lot to figure out but fun to mess with.

The music is incredible, with legit high-quality classical tracks. Some are dark, some are light, and all of them fit perfectly. You can tell they put a lot of effort into it.

+ Exemplary music direction and visual style.
+ Voice acting is good stuff.
- Sometimes the sound fx for damage is earrape.

[h2]Gameplay (7.5/10)[/h2]
+ Decently solid builds and variety, at first, though eventually the game devolves to either gitgud or 
[spoiler]delete everything in one hit with OP builds[/spoiler].
+ Solid enemy and boss variety.
+ Size-able amount of content.
~ It's turn-based combat with a counter mechanic.
~ Builds can be a bit streamlined during progression
~ The game expects you to both explore and know your limits, a partially-streamlined exploration system, you lose nothing by not exploring, but you should do any content that's relevant, though try not to overlevel, some story beats really work only when the fights are drawn out.
- The counter mechanic is almost pattern-memory required, rather than reactions.

[h1]Summary (10/10)[/h1]
The game's writing, audio and visual standard are so high they override the combat issues.
I am not a lover of the JRPG genre. You will not see me claim to like turn-based combat or esoteric time-wasting mechanics. But few JRPGs (yes, it is a JRPG) have the means to actually make me care about the characters. Last time I enjoyed a JRPG of any measure, it was Astlibra. This blows that out of the water and makes me want to rethink my scoring system, because I gave Nier a 9(ish)/10 but honestly this is a few levels above that for me. Vibe things, I guess. 
As a vibe, this is a 10/10 game.",True,1760982858,3015,50
1903340,"I wanna start by saying this may be the only game I've played that I would call, without a doubt in my mind, a MASTERPIECE. I loved everything about it, except the platforming puzzles :). 
- First and foremost THE MUSIC is the best music I've heard in a game so far! It both ties everything together and enhances every scene, fight and zone.
- Beautifully written story with twists and turn at every point, that just keeps you wanting for more
- Amazing english voice actors ( I have only played the english audio version)
- Mind blowing visual design
- Pretty nice combat (as I am not used to this style)

1903340,"good game overall, however ! one particular aspect absolutely destroyed my capacity to enjoy the game,
the 'genius' game writers decided it would be a good idea to kill of your main character during the main story (character who I also found to be the most likeable one in the game). 

I am not kidding, your main character that you become attached to dies (scripted story death) and cannot be recovered from that point on - it is replaced by an extremely obnoxious fellow that becomes your main :|

this is not even funny -  I honestly pretty much stopped playing the game after that point. 
If I wanted to watch promising sci-fi drama with a retarded ending I would go and watch Game of Thrones or Wheel of Time again, but I won't, just like I won't come back to playing this game.

Why is modern story writing in general so utterly trash ??

1903340,"Hands down the best RPG I have played since FFVIII was a new release. As a fan of RPGs in general and notable entries being FFVIII, Legend of the Dragoon, and The Last Remnant, I mean to say this might be the best of all time. 

The battle mechanics are new and fresh and have an actual learning curve. You can customize your style and even Min/Max to your hearts content. This is a true turn based system with an active component that is configurable to your desire to either set and forget or to require additional inputs for max damage. 

The story is beautiful, funny, and painful all at once. It keeps you guessing if you are the type to try and figure out what is happening with the world. If instead you are the kind to let it unfold, it keeps you engaged. While most games in recent history I would play while listening to music or an audio book, I was unable to with this game as the score was alluring and audio clues enhance the experience. 

Finally, the game leaves you wanting more of everything. There are battles that require you to squeeze every last drop out of your characters to the point that they become broken (or rather broken in a different way.... lol), and 100% the game is difficult but not tedious. There is lore that you must chase but the world is so interesting that I cant wait for the next entry into the series. While most things are spelled out, some of the lore must be teased from between the proverbial lines and there are easter eggs hidden by the dev's that are not blatant but certainly intriguing when you grasp their meaning. The character development makes you feel for the people, and the implications of certain story line elements wrench your heart around. Overall, what an excellent game!

1903340,"Everything you've heard about this game is true. I went in almost entirely blind after this flew under my radar, and I can pretty confidently say this is now my personal favorite game, period.

It's really crazy that a game this perfect can release in the modern industry landscape: gorgeous graphics with unique and longevous art direction, optimized so well that my almost 5 year old computer can run it without issue; weighty, satisfying turn-based combat that starts simple but becomes complex and customizable the deeper into the game you get (even if endgame builds are largely one-shot based); an UNBELIEVABLE soundtrack that is going to dominate my playlist until this time next year....

The writing and characters deserve their own praise for not only being vivid and extensively fleshed out but also real, with palpable flaws and realistic reactions to/depictions of things like grief and anxiety. (I gaze longingly at party members 4 and 5). There's so much information you can infer about them and their mindsets just from watching them talk as you play.....it's entrancing. The central themes (those being grief and escapism) are very relatable and very relevant, both to the party and pretty much every character in some way shape or form. With this in mind, the way more light-hearted and comedic moments were presented to break the tension had me giggling out loud. I was laughing out loud one minute and on the verge of tears the next. This games ending is like a million daggers in your heart in the best way possible and it might be controversial to say, but I really enjoyed it. Probably the only complaint I have about the game as a whole is that I'd have appreciated a minimap for some areas (I glare directly at the Gestral Village), and that once your power spikes after getting Those Two Pictos you can pretty much curbstomp everything left in the game bar the hardest superboss (hype as shit btw).

The commentary and philosophies this game presents are genuinely incredibly engaging, and in case you forgot after all that yapping, there's a fucking masterpiece of a video game attached to it. As of writing I've defeated every superboss (again, hype as SHIT) and collected every achievement, and never once did it feel like a chore.

1903340,"A masterpiece of a game released in 2025. With a nostalgic turn-based combat system with a very unexpected twist of this time forcing you to engage in the otherwise mundane combat system and many mechanics that were present in classic titles like Final Fantasy, the game has not failed to evoke nostalgia factors constantly for me.

An amazing story written that is not too short and not too long, with plenty of twists that gets you hooked. The game is also kind enough to allow you to finish the game with minimal grind and has a difficulty setting which reduces damage to mere 10% definitely allows anyone to enjoy the game for its world, story and aesthetics.

While I absolutely loved this game I do think the combat system eventually got overbearing and frustrating as the parry and dodge mechanic got cumbersome rather than enjoyable. With some optional mini bosses and bosses basically requiring full parry or fairly high successful dodge rates to even have a chance at winning the battle, this feature eventually feels more punishing than enjoyable.

If you played on normal difficulty as I did, some bosses basically end your runs the moment you miss one or two parries or dodges, and the intentional arrhythmic pattern makes it hard to predict with sound cues not being very consistent at times. Imagine playing a rhythm game and they don't accept anything less than full combo, even on your first time playing that song. That's what it sometimes feels like.

Thankfully there's a story mode difficulty, if you're really here just for that. With all the extra content you can do in the game and the expansive world it gives you, it's still worth it even if the combat system is frustrating.

However, there is no mini map, and it can be fairly hard to navigate around and keep track of the ever branching paths of each map and level. If you're directionally challenged this would definitely be a major pain point for you.

Overall, still worth the purchase and giving it a shot. The story constantly kept me excited to go for more and I had a good 20+ hours of doing the extra content.",True,1760933368,3209,7

The characters have interactions that feel genuine. The soundtrack is bold, fresh, and not tiring whatsoever. The environments are gorgeous and imaginative.

Of course, every RPG needs a good story, and this game delivers in ways that I haven't seen in may games in a long while. I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say I was hooked. Once I finished the prologue, I knew this game was something special. I'm probably going to be quoting several lines from this game for a long, long time.

As for the combat: Yes, it's turn-based, but it's different than most! I found myself needing to be completely engaged when attacking and defending. Unlike in Paper Mario, the dodges and parries matter, sometimes demanding the level of precision you would need in Sekiro. Character builds have major impacts to and you are given SO MUCH to experiment with. Each character has their own style of combat, so you will need to manage how to shape each character to the needs of the team, which is especially important for the post-game content.

So I said ""mostly true,"" and you may be asking yourself ""why?"" These are mostly minor nitpicks that I can overlook, and I've seen much worse from AAA studios. The main two issues I have are around character builds: 1) they're a bit messy to manipulate, and 2) the spike in demand for increasingly better builds really only appear in the late post game content.

1903340,"To summarize, this game is basically a more mature Persona game in both game mechanics (additional features) and storyline.

I originally bought this to spit on Ubisoft, and hearing positive comments about this game from Team Cherry and from the French President. There was a reason that tempted me to get this game in the first two months of its release, which was the soundtrack, where I only listened to ""Lumiere"" and was nearly convinced to buy the game.

I actually regret not buying the game in the first two months of its release because I was in awe in the prologue and got really emotional in the end. I'm still in Act 2 at the time of typing this review, and the story is amazing as it knows when to be serious and a good time to be humorous. Right now, it's the third game that made me shed a tear, and the first to make me shed a tear multiple times.

The game mechanic is really fun; it's a turn-based strategy that awards you for precision from attacking at a perfect time or parrying all the enemy's attacks to return the damage to the sender. What I like is that, despite the game being turn-based, there are some enemies where it will never be your turn for a while, such as enemies doing four turns before yours or doing infinite turns just because you suck at parrying (this might have been me for three attempts for THAT chromatic enemy). 

However, what I have mixed thoughts on are some of the tutorials, such as the jump and gradient counter, as they never explain that enemies using those attacks meant you should be ready to parry, not to immediately parry as I did a lot in my first hour in Act 2.",True,1760923366,2379,25

1903340,"Modern classic bruh, the narrative is very confident and u already give a gaf about it two minutes in. The events between each of the Acts are unforgettable and it's obviously best experienced blind so I'll shut up on that end. I think calling the design revolutionary or innovative is misleading, because the mechanics are instead thoroughly inspired by some of the best JRPGs in history and just smashes em all together into one of the best gameplay loops I've played thru in years, with a lot of flexibility and an emphasis on making fun kits. Expert mode is just challenging enough for somebody who is a little too busy to sit on a challenging boss for a week, but if you're looking for some souls BS or are worried it will be too easy the postgame will change your mind, especially one optional fight.

My one complaint is that although the soundtrack is probably my favorite OST ever, it's implemented a little awkwardly. I understand what they were going for with the adaptive battle/area themes and sometimes it works well, but looping the first section of a song over and over is not really how music is supposed to be structured for listening. I found the moments where I'm finally listening to AMAZING tracks like the Paintress Theme in-game and not on Spotify for the 500th time kind of disappointing. Combat music choice in general for several sections in the Act 3/postgame also felt a little repetitive, they could've picked more than the handful they did and pumped more hype into a few of the superbosses. In fact, some tracks like ""Atelier de Clea - Contre le Coeur"" that have great vocals NEVER play the vocals throughout the entire game to extent of my knowledge/research. I think it would've been a wiser choice for Sandfall to drop some of the sound engineering and let Lorien Testard's phenomenal tracks speak for themselves in a few sections.

Again though: I am only complaining about this because I have listened to the soundtrack religiously since first booting the game up several months ago... This one of the best OSTs and general sets of orchestrations ever, and it's a shame that I think it sounds best on Spotify... 10/10 experience nonetheless, I'm curious if other people feel the same about the soundtrack or if I just listened to it too much outside of the game bc I love it <3",True,1760917096,4476,5

1903340,"As much as I would love to indulge my contrarian self, and as shameful as it is for me to praise what is essentially Persona made by the French, I must agree with the rest of the faceless goons creeping around this platform. Yes indeed, although the capacity for joy has all but left my mortal shell, Expedition 33 is all I have come to demand from a video game and more: a product of passion, not greed; brought forth by valued craftsmen, not employees; motivated by their own artistic integrity, not projected revenue. I can hardly believe this is the team's first project. Where did these people even come from? And where have they been all our lives? Doubtless, a mystery for historians to ponder.

Now, my religion usually forbids me to engage in monetary transactions unless there's money to be saved, and I was resigned to the prospect of waiting a good two years or longer for a chance at a big discount. Fortunately for my wallet, however, and unfortunately for my dignity as an independent human being, I happen to be acquainted with a dumb little gremlin who's allergic to money. If by any chance you're reading this, I appreciate the gesture. Don't do it again. So anyway, here I am booting up the hot new thing, and - Notre-Dame de Paris, my room is on fire! Games aren't supposed to have so many particle effects. Why, if my computer was a woman, she would be begging me to divorce her. To little avail, of course. My enjoyment of the game is way more important than a robot wife's comfort. Which is to say, the level of detail is astounding. The environments are whimsical and dream-like, the characters are incredibly well realized and the Lumina system allows me to ruin some of the greatest boss fights ever seen with my degenerate strategies.

Actually, while we're on the topic of characters, I'm eternally grateful to the developers for allowing me to play as an adult man who doesn't have to rely on his government-mandated surrogate child to emote on his behalf all the time. Quite refreshing indeed, but I will be forced to deduct ten points for dear Gustave's pseudo-bionic arm, a trope which I feel has gotten just a little tired. Gee, Gustave, you're just so cool with your irrelevant disability and lack of symmetry. Can somebody tell me why every modern protagonist has to be missing an arm? Why is it always one arm? Talk trash about Human Revolution all you like, at least Jensen had the balls to go all the way. Man was missing both of those suckers and then some. And what's so special about fake arms, anyway? I see this crap in every game I play. Metal arms, wooden arms, living arms, magic arms, gun arms, sword arms, arms that explode, arms that electrocute, arms with grappling hooks, arms that vibrate your position in space-time, arms that make you coffee in the morning, arms that hold you tight and say they love you, no really, we do, we were wrong to leave you. We're happy to be your parents and we're proud of you. I'm sick of it. We have four limbs, don't we? When are we going to see Doom Guy jumping over a demon with his deployable spring legs like he's Inspector Gadget? Never, that's when, because game developers are a bunch of quacks bigger than my psychologist.

...where was I? Ah, yes, presentation. Especially the part of it which pertains to sound design. Fun fact: human beings are just as emotionally responsive to sound as they are to colour, perhaps even more so the former. I considered adding a little something about olfactory memory to go with that statement, too, but decided against it. I don't think we as an industry are ready for that conversation, and besides, this game review's already too long as it is. But regardless, it's clear that Sandfall put a lot of effort and resources into making sure that the score was varied and the actors had clear and proper direction. In fact, even more so than the writing or the art direction, by themselves already miles above the standard fare, I'd go so far as to cite the voice acting as the primary reason behind this game's success. I cannot in all honesty recall the last time I experienced such consistently life-like performances across an entire cast (in a feature-length RPG, no less!), but I could absolutely come up with a list of the past one hundred times I ended up rolling my eyes at badly written and delivered dialogue in an otherwise perfectly serviceable story. Which is strange, isn't it? It's almost as if having the characters talk it out like real people directly correlates to stronger audience engagement and therefore bigger returns on your investment. Yet it's nearly always a footnote in the development process, and I just don't seem to know why.

But I do know what I want: I want better music and dialogue in video games. I want to see the clashing of different ideologies. I want to care about the characters and their stuggles, I want to feel sad when they're sad and feel mad when they're mad. I want empathy, because feeling is what separates art from entertainment, and I've no money to spare for toys. I want more Clair Obscur. And less robot arms.

For quite some time now, I've been trying to find a game that sparks my love for gaming. The same way I felt when I was younger. I'm not going to lie when I say I had ZERO interest in Expedition 33, my uncle showed it to me initially and it looked a bit cool. But still I wasn't interested.

Until one day, I had received a gift on May 9th from my uncle. I decided, why not, it doesn't hurt to play it for a little bit. At first, the intro to the game was a bit confusing to me and didn't really make sense. This gave me a purpose to continue playing. I played more and more, and I just couldn't stop until I got all the achievements, beat the game, and finish the side stories. 

But even with finishing nearly everything the game had to offer, I then started a NG+ run to feel the story again. To see the foreshadowing that I missed out before, run around the environments to collect things. The gameplay is immensely satisfying to me, along with the beautiful music, and the raw and natural story. All this sparked my interest in gaming again. I strive to find an original concept like this game again in the future.

All in all, this game is Whoooo, but also Wheeee! So the Wheeee balances the Whoooo.

For those who come after,
Tomorrow comes.

1903340,"I have so many feelings about this game: love, passion, heartbreak, frustration... Essentially, I admire Expedition 33 deeply as a work of art, but have mixed feelings on some of the gameplay. I've written a short essay.

The Impeccable:

--Story: One of the most well written, complex, emotional stories I have ever experienced. I cried in the prologue and sobbed uncontrollably in the epilogue. The characters were so real and complicated, the worldbuilding was unique and engrossing, and the plot twisted at every turn and kept me glued to the screen through every cutscene. This game deserves an arsenal of Emmys for the cinematography and acting. Truly a masterpiece.

--Art: The primary theme of this game is art, and the art of the game itself did not disappoint. I loved exploring the wildly illustrated world, seeing what new and twisted enemy would come on the screen next, and took so many screenshots I could make an art book of them. The human characters were beautifully animated and so realistic in their expressions and speaking.

--Music: Gorgeous. Emotional. Diverse. Just wow. The score of this game ranged from hauntingly beautiful vocals to screamo punk to classical piano to grooving funk, and yet all of it somehow, incomprehensibly, blended together and formed a single aesthetic consistent with the game.

--Character Builds: I loved the system of weapons, skills, pictos/luminas, and stat points. Each character had an entirely unique and fascinating system of fighting, but within each preset build, you had so much agency to customize their specializations. It was a lot to learn, but I really enjoyed it once I understood it and have never seen anything like the builds E33 presented.

The Mixed:

--Fighting: I did enjoy the mix of turn-based and real-time block/parry/counterattack. It was engaging and worked seamlessly in battles. I really enjoyed the longer boss fights where I could master the timings of all the different attacks and build up skills throughout the fight to stack bigger and bigger damage payoffs.

However - early game fights were super repetitive and tedious. I felt like I ran into an enemy every other step and had to start the same fight over and over again with limited skills that bored me. It was fun that every new type of enemy had new attacks to learn, but all the side fights just felt like a grind. This did improve throughout the game somewhat as skills became more complex, but I still got bored by the repetition.

The Not Great:

--Pacing: Despite 8 months of anticipation for this game and my overflowing enthusiasm when I first started it, I almost quit multiple times in the first 10 hours. That's how long it took me to recruit all Act 1 characters: 10 hours. The start of this game was just SO slow. I appreciate that each character had unique fighting styles to learn, but really Sandfall, we're a bit smarter than you give us credit for. I was so bored during the early levels, and the builds took a long time to gain power and complexity. Once I got to Act II, the pacing picked up significantly, but then slowed again in Act III.

--Lack of Structure: I spent so much time in Act I wandering around, getting lost, and not knowing where to go next. The lack of maps within regions drove me absolutely insane, and the single listed quest at any given time was essentially ""keep playing the game."" I'm sure some people enjoyed the 'explore and find out for yourself' style of this game, but I would have appreciated just a 'bit' more direction via maps and objectives. Once again, Act II was much better than Act I in this regard, but then Act III went back to the 'figure it out for yourself' model. I don't know how I would have gotten through Act III without online guides telling me where new areas were and which ones I could handle at what level.

Conclusion

So - would I recommend this game? Yes. I can't stop thinking about it. I think E33 deserves its accolades for being a cinematic masterpiece, for its unique builds/fighting, and for its origins in a humble French developer who sold millions of copies in the first few months. I do think the game could be improved in many ways, and it wasn't the greatest gameplay experience I've ever had. The inconsistent pacing and lack of structure frustrated me to no end. But overall I was deeply affected by this game, and I think that deserves a lot of credit.",True,1760895647,3194,4

1903340,"Simply put, this is one of the best pieces of fictional media ever made, and it just so happens to be in video game form. The story is incredible, the visuals are stunning, and the music is absolutely breath-taking. I think this may very well have the best intro to any game ever created, guaranteed to hook you in the first half hour. All the different elements of this game mix and mash perfectly and compliment each other so well.

The combat is the only thing about this game I think you might find subjective. It is a turn based system, but it is a very active turn based system. There is very much a ""get good"" factor with this game as far as parrying and dodging goes especially if you choose to play on the higher difficulties as the windows to pull off these mechanics are extremely tight. 

Graphically it's not perfect. There are moments where characters hands/objects they are holding clip through clothing or environment, but none of these moments are egregious in my opinion. That being said it's probably the only downside to this game graphically as the environments, skills, characters, cutscenes, and effects are gorgeous.

Characters are relatable and behave like real people. The writing done for this game was immaculate.

Musically this game has something for just about everybody. The soundtrack for this game is so diverse you are bound to find a track that you can really vibe with. I think that this games soundtrack will comfortably sit among the greatest OST's of all time. 

All things considered, this very well may be the best game I have ever played and it easily sits in my top 10 favorite games of all time, maybe even top 5. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is to gaming what The Godfather is to movies, an absolute masterpiece, and a clear reminder that when done correctly creating a video game can be a beautiful work of art.

- Top-tier V.O, specifically Jennifer English's, whose voice soothes greater than any female vocalist's, and Charlie Cox's, who, as Gustave, you want to be your best friend forever;
- Battle animations, the slickest I've seen, making the characters feel powerful in a way I've never before experienced;
- Music, surprising, melody-focused as in the days of old.

In sum, a moody journey of thrilling, nicely-difficult, battles supported by a kick-ass, excellently-acted story.

Though I did play on Deck, I did so through GeForce Now, both to take advantage of the awe-inspiring graphics, and to get the high, stable frame-rate, needed for those tight timing windows.

Outside of not having a minimap, which is annoying, the one (the only?) aspect keeping this game from being perfect is the absence of a location checklist. On the overworld, areas above your level show a reddish entrance, so you put a mental pin in them (in-game pins don't exist, which, really, is a ... stupid oversight, sorry). Then, once appropriately level, they lose their reddish cast. But once that later period comes, where have you and haven't been?

As I usually find cons, alone, in game reviews unhelpful, I'd recommend making a little note on your phone of what locations you've visited--along with the specific locations of yet-too-tough bosses on the overworld (again, map pins not existing), because I misplaced said bosses far too often.",True,1760892603,7049,22

1903340,"My english vocabulary is too small to describe the range of emotions i felt playing this game.
I really liked the setting when I first saw the reveal trailer. Then it TURNED out it's a turn-based RPG. I'm not a big fan of that, really. But after I saw the reception, I decided to give it a try. It was one of my best decisions this year. This game and Marvel Midnight Suns showed me that turn-based RPGs definitely worth a try.
It's hard to describe how good this game is. This is the first game I played twice in a row and still had fun. Visuals, story and atmosphere are great. The soundtrack is something out of this world. 
I don't know what else to say to make someone play this game. Just buy it and play, I hope you won't regret. I didn't.",True,1760883059,4459,5
1903340,"Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 completely blew me out of the water. The world is jaw-dropping in every scene, and the combat feels absolutely amazing. I was a bit skeptical at first, because I don't really like turn-based games, but the parry mechanic makes everything feel so fluid and like so much fun, its extremely satisfying. The soundtrack? Absolutely insane; it varies from sad piano, absolutely amazing vocals from Alice, and great boss themes that still live in my head and still listen to almost daily. I came in as a massive Hollow Knight/Silksong fan‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm putting this above them, even when Silksong was an absolute 10/10 for me as well. That‚Äôs how special this game is; it's a piece of art with a dev team that has put so much love and passion into this game. You don't get these type of games often, so I hope this is a sign to all game developers that you dont need big names and multi-billion dollar companies to make a great game; just pure love, passion and talented people. Both Expedition and Silksong are great examples.

What really surprised me the most is how much heart there is in the story. It‚Äôs dark, emotional, and every chapter pulled me in even deeper. The voice acting is phenomenal, some of the best I‚Äôve ever heard, that really brings the characters to life and make the emotional scenes hit really hard, especially the voice actors of Maelle, Verso and Gustave, but I also really love Renoir's and Lune's. This isn‚Äôt just a short RPG either; it‚Äôs packed with sooo much content. The main story itself is already filled with content, but now that I completed that part, there is still so much to explore with hidden bosses and weapons, and all the ways you can experiment with skills and builds.

This is one of those rare games that comes along and completely raises the bar. For me, it‚Äôs not just a great game, not just the best game of this year, but it might even be my favorite game of all time. I know that recency bias exists, so I also don't want to be too definitive about this statement, but I also don't want to take away any credits from this game that it absolutely deserves.",True,1760882380,2603,24

HOWEVER, the delayed attacks just put me off. In my opinion, delayed attacks are a cheap design and just ""inflates"" the difficulty. Oh, here comes this mob with a steel chair. Wait, he's winding up. Hold on, don't parry yet...wait...just a little bit-

AND HE HITS YOU WITH A DROP KICK INSTEAD

The terrible performance also makes the delayed attacks worse. I pressed parry button, BUT fps dropped so frozen eveque just one tap my team instead. Bravo!

Also the parkour/volleyball games suck. Delayed attacks and stiffy animations, not to mention to egregious zoomed out screen making the gestrals hard to spot and destroy the raft.

Gameplay: 7/10

This is without a doubt one of those games that will go down in history as one those rare gems every gamer should know about and play.
Even if you don't enjoy the gameplay, fair enough, put it on easy and roll through. Everything else about this experience is absolutely worth it to dive in for.

That this game came from a rather inexperienced first-timer team, and the writing in particular from a writer who has no published works beforehand, and mostly just wrote for herself is... 
They deserve every award they will receive.

There are some issues, though, that shouldn't be ignored:
- Why, oh why, is there no ""repeat battle"" button? Instead, you have to wait until enemies finish you off if you want to restart a battle. Utter waste of time.

- Why, when you repeat a battle, does the cinematic before the battle repeat as well? Sure, you can skip that, but why even repeat it in the first place? Waste of time, again.

- Some bosses have multiple phases, which is nice. But why is there no checkpoint in-between them? In all cases, a boss's first phase is drastically easier than the second and once you are able to get to the second phase, you won't struggle with the first anymore. This lack of a checkpoint here is, again, a waste of time.

- There is great depth to the combat system in theory. All the effects, synergies and the ways the characters interact with each other. It could be great, if it weren't for one thing: Even min-maxing doesn't do a whole lot of difference if you don't master the parrying (on Hard+). And if you do master the parrying, it is really all you need and you can ignore all the other systems.
Those two parts of the combat are at odds with each other design-wise, with the real-time parts making all the rest almost entirely superficial.
The combat would have been better with a more traditional turn-based system as well as with a more traditional real-time system.

- Some of the encounters feel more like ""gotcha!""s that were made annoying on purpose to mess with the player. Not a fan of design like that.",True,1760872254,2600,248

1903340,"Before playing this game I had heard and seen the insane amount of praise around it and I was kinda skeptical and since I wasn't in the mood for a turn based rpg at the time it launched, I dismissed it for the time. After half a year now I finally decided to give it a try, and I think the biggest praise I can give it in one sentence is this: At least for me, It lives up to all the praise and then some.
I don't want to discuss this game in too much detail here as to not spoil things, but I will say some general things still, since I cannot help myself but praise the game now that I've seen basically all it has to offer. The presentation and artstyle are just absolutely beautiful, the music and overall story are genuinely close to if not on par with Nier Automata, which for me still is probably the pinnacle of this medium in these two regards, and on top of all of this it somehow is also probably my favourite turn based rpg in terms of its actual gameplay, and this cannot be understated. Like this game, a turn based rpg, which I wouldn't really say is my favourite genre of games generally, reached the same heights with at least some of its fights (my favourite being a very late game optional boss) for me that fighting, learning and overcoming a really good hard fight in something like Elden Ring, Dark Souls 3 or Sekiro reached. That is not at ALL something I was expecting to get out of a turn based rpg, let alone one made by a pretty small team.
So yea, honestly, huge respect and praise to the devs. This joins the collection of games I would point to as a counterargument whenever anyone tries to argue that games are not art. If you are even remotely interested in this game, go get it and play it when you are able to, it really is one of THOSE games that you really owe it to yourself to experience. And so another entry into my all time favourites has been made, side by side with Hollow Knight: Silksong. This really is one hell of year.",True,1760869197,3675,38

1903340,"To say that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 might be one of my personal favourite games of the past few years would be an understatement. In an era where Game Design has become Corporate and Stale, only following whatever is currently popular, Expedition 33 dared not only to follow its own path, but also to provide one of the most Enthralling and Immersive Stories of the past Decade. The World feels real. The Story, once it grips you, never lets go until that final Line, and The Characters are as fleshed out as some of the best Protagonists in Gaming. 

This isn't even talking about the Gameplay, which is arguably, the most important aspect of any Game. It's rare I find the combat in a JRPG as engaging as this. Challenging but rewarding, Combat never once became stale. With so much depth underneath the Surface, yet not once does it fall into the usual Trap of becoming too complicated to Build Characters in a specific way. 

My biggest Gripe outside of some Minor Nitpicks is the Performance. Unreal Engine 5 is of infamous at this point for its issues. In Truth, it feels kind of unfair to bring this up, as this is mostly out of the Hands of Developers and the Fault entirely lies on Epic for this. I do not believe that a Game like this could exist on any other Engine, and truthfully, it is hardly the worst optimisation I've seen in a game of this scale, hence Why I can still recommend it. I just ask that people double check their Hardware before buying as to avoid disappointment. But even then, a game of this scale for around ¬£40? (roughly $50 USD) is hard to say no to. 

Even if you're not a fan of JRPGs, I can safely say, you'll hardly be disappointed here. Just give it a Chance.",True,1760860251,2331,7

Is it perfect?  No... But it is damn close.  

The story, the settings, the characters, and soundtrack are all incredible and, despite the heavy story content, so much fun.  The second ""level"" had me panning the camera around just to look at all the neat things that were happening.  
The acting in the story scenes was particularly good.  The mo-cap and finished animations giving each character subtle movements and telling glances.  So much of the subtext and feelings of each character are done with the eyes in a way that I have not seen in a video game of this scale.  It really was like watching a movie.
The story itself is dark and unique and doesn't answer all the questions it asks, but it does so in a way that feel natural and ""real"".  It is a story about grief and loss and dealing with that, but its not as overly moody as some indie games can be.  

The game-play itself and the mechanics is where it starts to show a little bit. 
Personally I like feeling like I am playing a god by the end of a good RPG, and here... well it felt that way a little too soon.  If you do as much as you can, as early as you can, leaving the final boss for the end, that fight is a pretty short... and thats how most fights are.   If you are under leveled, you get trounced unless you have the parry/dodge thing down.  if you are at the right level (which you will be for most of the game), they are fun, with a fair difficulty.  But if you are slightly over-leved, like the big monster in the sea wrecked you the first time, so you played a bunch of story and side quests, gained levels and went ""Oh yeah, I should try that again..."" He's a push over.  The ""9999"" damage number that was so saught after in the Final Fantasy days comes quick here.  Does it ruin the game?  Not at all! But it does take some of the challenge away if you leave some fights to long.  At the same time, there are a couple of fights that I haven't finished yet because I am not strong enough!

The other gripe I had was the camera at times, and how it works in battles.  You get a fairy large character to play and he sometimes blocks his own menus.... I had the camera duck behind tall grasses to get the right angle on an enemies attack, and totally block it from view... hard to parry that...  But again, It wasnt game breaking, but it does keep this game from getting that ""PERFECT"" rating.

In the end, this is a game that needs to be played.  Even with the warts and flaws, thi sis an achievment worth celebrating.  If you like story rich games, RPGs, deep stories, and enjoyable characters... play this game!",True,1760831491,5867,36

I‚Äôm just echoing most players when I praise the story, the music, and the hybrid turn-based/real-time gameplay. As a fan of FF10‚Äôs gameplay, Expedition 33 scratched that itch that studios don‚Äôt release too often anymore. I adored the turn-based combat system while mixing in real-time mechanics for dodging/parrying. The timing for the parrying system can be challenging at first, but you‚Äôll get the hang of it in time and the game rewards you for mastering this skill. As for the music, just spend a couple minutes on the main menu screen and you‚Äôll understand. What surprised me was how many musical genres were present in this game and how well it all worked together. And then there‚Äôs the story. I can count on one hand how many story narratives (whether it was a movie, a video game, a book, etc.) that actually moved me to tears. Expedition 33 is one of them. There‚Äôs a lot I could discuss here, but I‚Äôll just mention this: I love how Expedition 33 manages to create plenty of light and comedic moments in an otherwise dark and bleak world. One of my pet peeves in JRPGs is the overuse of fantasy races that primarily serve as comic relief (such as the Nopon from the Xenoblade series). The Gestrals, however, provide hilarious moments without being too out-of-place with the added bonus that their humor actually contributes to the narrative in a meaningful way.

I do have a couple critiques for the game though. The first one being menu navigation when accessing pictos, skills, etc. It can certainly feel a bit clunky especially when you‚Äôre in the late game and you have so many pictos to select from. As for gameplay, it can be quite easy to be overleveled for the final boss which results in the player just demolishing this fight, but a quick fix for this would be to unequip the ability that removes your 9999-damage cap. For the most part, these issues didn‚Äôt really bother me too much.

After 69 hours of playing Expedition 33, I can safely say that this game holds a special place in my heart, and I won‚Äôt soon forget it. In time, I will give this game another playthrough in NG+ and try to pick up on all the foreshadowing that I missed throughout my first playthrough. What an incredible debut from Sandfall Interactive and I look forward to seeing what they develop next!",True,1760824292,4146,1

 The music is memorable and evokes emotions. It's expressive and diverse. I bought the soundtrack, and my mom asked me what kind of music it was (even though she's not interested in games). Amazing voice acting of the characters, unusually lively, in the characters you BELIEVE.
Gameplay. Unusual. A plus to the game for the ability to take out enemies before they have time to do something, I parry and dodge very poorly. It's cool that the gameplay for each character is unique. Skins are cute.

The story is great and the highlight of the game, with twists youd never expect. Intriguing.. fun etc. Genuinely the only negative I have with the game is the parrying being a REQUIREMENT.",True,1760800275,2326,86

The story is heavy and dense and like no game I've ever seen before. 
Of course, the whole soundtrack is another masterpiece by itself, but elevates the game experience so much!

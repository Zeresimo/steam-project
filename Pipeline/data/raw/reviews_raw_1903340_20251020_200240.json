        "review": "It's been a few years since I’ve felt compelled to write a game review, but I felt the need to do so after Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 became one of my favorite video games of all time. My only regret in playing this game is that it may have actually ruined video games for me because of how much better it is compared to most other games. \n\nI’m just echoing most players when I praise the story, the music, and the hybrid turn-based/real-time gameplay. As a fan of FF10’s gameplay, Expedition 33 scratched that itch that studios don’t release too often anymore. I adored the turn-based combat system while mixing in real-time mechanics for dodging/parrying. The timing for the parrying system can be challenging at first, but you’ll get the hang of it in time and the game rewards you for mastering this skill. As for the music, just spend a couple minutes on the main menu screen and you’ll understand. What surprised me was how many musical genres were present in this game and how well it all worked together. And then there’s the story. I can count on one hand how many story narratives (whether it was a movie, a video game, a book, etc.) that actually moved me to tears. Expedition 33 is one of them. There’s a lot I could discuss here, but I’ll just mention this: I love how Expedition 33 manages to create plenty of light and comedic moments in an otherwise dark and bleak world. One of my pet peeves in JRPGs is the overuse of fantasy races that primarily serve as comic relief (such as the Nopon from the Xenoblade series). The Gestrals, however, provide hilarious moments without being too out-of-place with the added bonus that their humor actually contributes to the narrative in a meaningful way.\n\nI do have a couple critiques for the game though. The first one being menu navigation when accessing pictos, skills, etc. It can certainly feel a bit clunky especially when you’re in the late game and you have so many pictos to select from. As for gameplay, it can be quite easy to be overleveled for the final boss which results in the player just demolishing this fight, but a quick fix for this would be to unequip the ability that removes your 9999-damage cap. For the most part, these issues didn’t really bother me too much.\n\nAfter 69 hours of playing Expedition 33, I can safely say that this game holds a special place in my heart, and I won’t soon forget it. In time, I will give this game another playthrough in NG+ and try to pick up on all the foreshadowing that I missed throughout my first playthrough. What an incredible debut from Sandfall Interactive and I look forward to seeing what they develop next!",

From the angelic sound-track, breathtaking world-design, well-written story, and real-time turn-based combat; all handcrafted with insane amounts of passion behind it. The game didn't require any artificial hype pushing it to succeed, it was naturally generated from simply doing the right things, and Sandfall caring about they put out. What kind of developers release FREE additional late-game content to a fully finished game that's already sold over 5 million copies?? Ones that [b] love [/b] their game and the community they built, power to good studios. \n\nPlaying through the game to its fullest completion, im left stunned at how an unknown studio was able to produce such a masterpiece in an already dominated genre. I would be [b] UTTERLY [/b] surprised if they aren't a Game of the Year nominee.",

You can do side quests and kill optional bosses even after finishing the main story, however, I would strongly suggest try finishing the character related quests/relationships before reaching the end to make it less weird.

        "review": "A great story that evoked a storm of emotions. It's been a long time since I've been so blown away by a plot twist. I even shed a tear at the end.\n Beautiful visuals, beautiful locations, well-designed characters with lively emotions, and unique enemy designs.\n The music is memorable and evokes emotions. It's expressive and diverse. I bought the soundtrack, and my mom asked me what kind of music it was (even though she's not interested in games). Amazing voice acting of the characters, unusually lively, in the characters you BELIEVE.\nGameplay. Unusual. A plus to the game for the ability to take out enemies before they have time to do something, I parry and dodge very poorly. It's cool that the gameplay for each character is unique. Skins are cute.\n\n Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is my nominee for the game of the year. Yes, a lot of goodies came out, but a lot or sequels or games straight from famous studios. And here we have an original setting and original gameplay.",

        "review": "Great game dragged down by its HORRIBLE parrying mechanic. And I do genuinely mean the worst possible way to ever implement parrying: In a turn based game where your success is bound to parrying attacks..... most the time you dont even know when to parry unless youve seen the attack before..... or you got lucky the music didnt cover the SOMETIMES EXISTING sound cue.\n\nThe story is great and the highlight of the game, with twists youd never expect. Intriguing.. fun etc. Genuinely the only negative I have with the game is the parrying being a REQUIREMENT.",

Perfectly serviceable, but can overwhelm the rest of the experience on harder tuned fights.\r\n\r\nWhere this game really shines is everywhere else; the story, the music, the atmosphere and writing, characters and humour, every bit of this world draws you in and makes you want to stay, even when you know you shouldn't.\r\n\r\nA must play.",

So i have never EVER been a fan of this type of game, i prefer FPS games, but this game has had me hooked since i opened it. I look forward to playing it daily after work. I would HIGHLY SUGGEST giving the game a shot. I am like 20 hours into the game and its probably one of the best games i've had the ability to enjoy; to be completely honest< i feel like the devs scammed themselves with it only being 49.99 but im not complaining, Long story short< game is worth every penny.",

It has one of my favorite soundtracks in gaming. Now having beat the game i can't comprehend how i thought of refunding such a masterpiece of a gaming experience.",

The art direction, lighting, and composition make every scene feel like a gallery piece, and the soundtrack is outstanding—it nails the mood from start to finish. The story works—clear themes, strong character moments, and a sense of purpose that kept me hooked.\n\nMy sticking point is pacing: the transition from Act 2 to Act 3 feels like a hard cut—you go from rallying to save Lumiere straight into processing the Dessender family’s grief, though taking a short break after Act 2 made the tonal pivot land better for me.\n\nAbout the finale:I loved the Verso ending; its grounded portrait of a family dealing with grief genuinely made me tear up. \n\nPros\n\nStunning art direction\n\nOutstanding soundtrack\n\nA genuinely good story with meaningful themes\n\nEndings with real emotional weight\n\nCons\n\nAbrupt pivot between Act 2 (saving Lumiere) and Act 3 (Dessender grief)\n\n",

What you think the game is initially, it's not, and then you have a whole new game on the same game, as the acts progress. It's as a new layer is added to the game every new act.  That's as much as I can say without giving any spoilers.\nThe story is heavy and dense and like no game I've ever seen before. \nOf course, the whole soundtrack is another masterpiece by itself, but elevates the game experience so much!\nThe mechanics are not exactly new, but are updated and modernized, making it very fluid. It's not perfect. I think the battle system is too dependant on the parry, which for me is a flaw. But that's totally a personal opinion, I know some people will find it great.",

        "review": "I will start this off by saying from a cinematic and artistic standpoint, this game is a masterpiece. It is beautiful, has fantastic audio and music. However, from a turn-based and gameplay point-of-view? Absolutely atrocious and I will gladly die on this hill and say that many of the fights in this game, are just awful and terribly designed and nothing can be said to change my mind.\n\nAnd before anyone wants to say \"skill issue\". I have done plenty of the harder fights, like the Chromatic enemy variants, with taking either zero damage or minimal damage with the use of parrying, and even winning fights with my last character, purely by parrying. So my criticism is fully justified and if you don't like it. Go cry about it to someone else. Anyway, moving on.\n\nYou have so many attacks that cannot possible see coming either due to how much the camera moves and the amount of flashy effects on screen that you will get hit by a lot of the attacks as you are simply incapable of seeing the attack coming to time your dodges and parries properly.\n\nSpeaking on not being able to see, there are many times I have failed a QTE for my attacks because the weapon effects are so flashy that it makes it impossible to see the arrow. So I ended up switching the QTE to auto complete so I'm not wasting AP for my bigger attacks that require me to NOT miss the QTE. \n\nLet's talk a bit more about parrying. The only way I have managed to time my parrying properly is a small audio queue that occurs right before the enemy is about to attack one of your characters. Without that audio queue, I would fail to parry every single time because of how hard it is to parry in this game with visual queues alone. However, that is not without it's own issues. You have to press Parry the VERY second you hear that sound or you risk getting hit. Now imagine having to maintain that level of focus for enemies that attack you 5-9 times in a row. \n\nThe sheer amount of focus this game requires you to maintain during fights is unbelievably exhausting and some fights you have to deal with so many attacks that is honestly sucks the enjoyment out of the game when you're spending more time fighting the game and it's mechanics, than actually enjoying the cinematic boss fight.\n\nThis game has more than enough identity to stand on it's own two feet without the senseless level of \"depth\" to the turn-based combat. They could have simply removed parrying, dodging and all of that other nonsense and this game would have done perfectly fine without them. There is enough depth to the combat without the need to parry, dodge and jump.\n\nAnd no, I am not going to \"tank\" my way through fights. I have seen the runs of people doing that and some fights are so purely based on having good luck that it makes me question how you could even play this game without parrying or dodging. \n\nMy recommendation? Just play on the lower difficulties. Do not attempt to play this on Expert like I have done. I will finish my playthrough on Expert, but I will absolutely not be doing another playthrough.",

It exceeds expectations in every way and reminds us what games can truly be.\n\nI can’t stress this enough: it’s worth every dollar, every minute, and every ounce of support.

Then after the intro, the gameplay and RPG elements started to be presented and it just took the expereince to the next level. Great combat, great character building RPG wise, great character building story wise. It's probably one of the top games ever made.   \n  \nMore detail on what captured me, I am not a big fan of playing multiple characters. but after getting Aim shot pictos and wanting to build around that, and then getting the solo pictos, combined with the lumina system I just made a team of 1 that just aim shot and basic attacked the whole game. (also only dodged, parry is pointless if you just do damage anyway why stress) (there are minimal instances of forced other character play) \n \nI played on gamepass first but came back and bought it on steam to do more playthroughs it's just a great game.",

        "review": "Phenomenal presentation with tedious gameplay.\r\n\r\nThe Good:\r\nThe game is incredibly beautiful, with God level music. Easily the best soundtrack in a very long time. The story is great with intriguing worldbuilding, and presented in a wonderful way with deep characters and all around amazing performance by the cast.\r\n\r\nThe Bad:\r\nBut this is not a movie, it's a video game, and the gameplay is simply mediocre. The turn based combat is decent enough, but it is completely invalidated by the parry system. Once you recognise the attack patterns there is no point in coming up with nice strategies. And at high difficulty the strategies don't matter anyway, unless you parry almost all attacks correctly. And besides watching cutscenes and fighting there is nothing else to do. \r\n\r\nThe Ugly:\r\nAnd on top of that this a UE5 slop that is a stuttery mess on a 7800x3d and 7900xtx that crashes at the most inoppurtunate times.\r\n\r\nDespite all this, the soundtrack, and the beautiful world is worth enduing the tedious gameplay loop.",

If you want a TLDR on this game, I litterally cannot give one while talking about the game specifically, all I can say is, 1. if you have enjoyed any turn based combat game I 100% guarantee you will love the gameplay of this game and 2. if you love very sincere stories with dark themes this is also the game for you. EIther one of those criteria makes this game worth it.\n\nI expect 90% of this review to be about the games story, I also expect 100% of this to be poorly written and all over the place as I try and write down my feeling towards this game while they are all still fresh.\n\nLet's start with basic observations and thoughts in regards to what I love about this game. This game is without a shadow of doubt the best turn based combat system I've ever played, period, it isn't even close. I love LITTERALLY EVERYTHING ABOUT this games combat system, it's unbeleivable, this is the only game I've ever played, and I've played a lot of games, whose combat feels like it was litterally made for me. Each character having a unique power and skill tree, AMAZING, adding real time dodging and parrying, AMAZING THE BEST THING EVER one of my fav games ever is Sekiro so litterally my dream come true. Enemies are so amazingly varied in design and moveset and animations, I'm litterally speachless on how much I love combat unbeleivable.\n\nI love the world, its absolutely stunning, this game FARMS screenshots like no other, every second feels ripped out of a painting. And visuals aside, I LOVE LOVE LOVE the approach the game takes to exploring the world. I'm a massive Final Fantasy fanboy so seeing this game implement that same iconic progression in exploration old school FF games had made me sooooo soo so happy. \n\nAlso I felt the game was really well paced in terms of combat balancing, spoilers for how many acts are in the game but while I felt a little OP coming out of Act 2, Act 3's comabt was great difficulty wise.\n\nOK enough about that, I need to talk about 2 things, story and characters. I'll start with characters cause thats much easier to talk about. I'm eh about them, their no BG3 party but also perfectly servicable in terms of depth for rpg party members. A couple things that I do think are pretty bad tho. 1. is the face MOCAP, it was really bad, characters frequently had what felt like 1 expression, and scenes where the devs clearly wanted you to interpet how a character feels from their face don't work cause the mocap sucks. Lucky thats saved by the phenominal VA work. I played in english and Maelle stole the show, shes played by shadowheart from BG3 and holy she can act incredible voice work. Lastly on characters, the game has a very very soft relationship system, it's pretty much persona social links but u rankup at night in ur camp. I, about 75% of the time, really didnt like these conversations, they felt like a waste of time, it felt like the devs wanted to do persona but didnt understand how persona engages people in these types of cutscenes.\n\nSpeaking of persona, time to talk about the story. Ok so to start, I'm gonna compare this game with Metaphor real quick, no spoilers for that game. In my opinion, Metaphor is excels where this game falters, and falters where this game excels. E.g. I dont love metaphors comabt system, I adore this games comabt system. I adore Metaphors story and characters. I'm neutral on this game's character and feel really annoyed/aggravated/depressed/saddened by this games story. \n\nI'll try keep this as spoiler free as possible but it's very hard to so just to be safe don't read this is you havent finished the game, go play it please its seriously a great game. Ok so this games I feel has 2 stories, 1 a lot more interesting than the other. 1 story, the one the game starts on, takes up about 90% of your playtime with the game. This story is interesting and engaing until the start of Act 2, where for me it felt like it got less and less interesting. A part of me wants to say this is intentional, and the developers thought that falling interest in story 1 would be supplimented by growing interest in story 2, which is what the game spends that last ~10% of it's runtime on. HOWEVER, i think the game does a horrible job at setting up and getting players interested in this other story. It does something I hate in a story which is when you set it up with mysterious characters who only say gobbldigook at the player, until their time comes to give a massive exposition dump (which btw happens so much later than the intitial gobbldigook that you forgot the finer details of what they were even saying). The worst part is, by the end of the game, I was convinced that story 2 was the more interesting story and I really really wish the game spent more time actually building it rather than giving tiny puzzle peices until story 1 ended and they decided ok lets dump it all on you at once. In my opinion, what they needed to do was supplement the motivation of story 1 with some motivation from story 2, to be specificic and SPECIFIC SPOILERS AHEAD, they needed to add motivation to go to the monolith other than to kill the paintress and stop the gommage that related to Maelle or Verso more intimately. \n\nPut consicely, is story 1 good? I really like it in Act 1, liked it less and less in Act 2 and if the game had ended on that fakeout after Act 2 then I would call it the worst story I've ever seen in a game. Is story 2 good? In Act 2 (it isnt in act 1), no, i dont like it at all. In Act three though it gets more engageing than story 1 ever was.\n\nLast thing on story is the ending. I also talked about the fake ending at the end of Act 2 above, but the actual ending of the game? I liked it, reaaaaaaaaly reminded me of Ghosts of Tsushima, expect worse. There are 3 factors when making a choice like the one in Ghost of Tsushima. 1. What I as the player wants. 2. What the character I'm playing as wants and 3. What the world the game exists in wants. In this game, for 1., I clearly wanted 1 choice over the other, it wasnt even a debate given the lack of setup story 2 got vs how much i love the world established in Act 1. 2. The characters wants were pretty clear and 3., unfortuntely I dont feel like I had enough information about the world of the game to decise, this game does not do a good job of setting up the world of Story 2 so I didnt know and honestly didnt really care.\n\nOk that's all promise, this is probably the worst review I've ever written, i feel slighly manic talking about this games story, definetly should have slept on it but oh well we ball I needed to get these raw thoughts written somewhere.\n\nTLDR: Crazy fun combat but just a fine story experience. Easy 8/10.",

        "review": "Reeeaally great and beautiful game, but only up until the start of act 3... everything before that had me hooked! The mystery, the world, the tone but once the story shifted (killing the paintress) i lost interest honestly.. the phrase “for those who come after” ends up feeling literally meaningless, I havent finished the game yet but i feel like this wont change by the end lol\n\nwhat pulled me in was the idea of the gommage, the strange and dangerous world, the paintress, the expeditioners, Verso whos not affected by the gommage and characters like Gustave, Lune, Sciel and ofc Esquie<3 that mix of mystery, SACRIFICE and discovery was what made it special to me but then all those interesting things got buried under the family (that literally came out of nowhere) plot twists and it really hurt the narrative ....\n\nthe game built such a strong f-ing theme around perseverance!! Like how the expeditioners gave their lives so the next generation could make it a little further even if they were doomed to fail, i really loved that idea, was honestly reminding me of AOT a little bit, when all odds are against humanity and survival, it felt powerful and the saying \"for those who come after\" felt meaningful!! but then act 3 just abandons it and shifts focus entirely to grief, escapism... I mean everything feels disconnected with these plots and twists\n\nits still an impressive game and clearly made with a lot of love but i honestly dont unbderstand how people glaze the story lol. Still recommend the game though, just the story is dookie.. Not saying the themes are bad, all im saying is act 3 ruined everything for me",

This game will bring you to the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. The voice actors all did very well, and their lines felt real and emotional. \r\nThe music was something that can only be described as incredibly emotional or overwhelmingly epic. It's difficult to stop playing when you've got addicting gameplay, with some of the most epic boss fights, and an intriguing mystery to solve. \r\nThe turn-based combat system is easy to play and complex enough to not be boring. Exploration isn't overwhelming, which is just really nice. \r\nUnfortunately, when you get access to all the areas in the world, it's essentially end game and it ruins the pacing of the game. It's unnatural to stop and explore the world when you got this big pressing issue that's supposed to be actively happening. You can explore it after the final mission, so that's nice at least.",

        "review": "My review is quite late. I do not normally review games and I struggled to describe this one beyond saying you must play it.\n\nPut simply, Claire Obscur: Expedition 33 re-awakened a childhood wanderlust. It is only the second game in more than 20 years that has given me the surreal urge to journey and discover the world for myself. The earliest game I recall giving me that feeling was The Legend of Zelda and, more recently, Red Dead Redemption 2. Red Dead was more about immersion while E33 delivers an otherworldly experience.\n\nI had no performance issues on my system with an Intel Core i7-11700K and an EVGA 3080 FTW.\n\nAs I progressed through the story I found myself constantly questioning and theory crafting where it would take me. It was not predictable but it unraveled in a way that felt natural. I wondered how the characters would travel and change and what they would learn about the world and their place in it.\n\nThe art style and music form a perfect backdrop to excellent cinematography, writing and delivery. The presentation is beautiful and rarely, if ever, misses a beat.\n\nDesign influences I would relate to include Bioshock, Alice Madness Returns, Persona, Devil May Cry, and Final Fantasy. It feels like the best aspects of those series come together to deliver a memorable adventure.\n\nThe pacing was overall quite good. The third act tightens up and several threads feel compressed, but I did not rush through it. I deliberately completed most optional content and finished nearly all side stories, leaving only the toughest fights like Simon for a post game return where I needed to optimize my build and practice my dodges. That approach highlighted how rewarding the optional content and post game preparation can be.\n\nCharacter work is a major strength. I badly wish one character who is lost early on had more screen time because his absence carried a strong emotional weight throughout the remainder of the story. Maelle is handled well. She reads as her age while showing a maturity earned by struggle. Luna and Cecile are welcome additions. Luna can be commanding and at times preachy, but she never talks down without reason and she grows into the party rather than forcing herself on it. At one point Luna expresses joy at meeting the Gestral Village, then i took a detour to the beach she sounds annoyed by us wasting time here with them, which felt slightly inconsistent and jarring. Cecile is a joyful presence with a maternal or teacherly air that does not need exposition it just feels right. Her manner made me want to learn more the way the best teachers do. Their relationship never read to me as romantic in a shallow way. They come across as sisters or best friends who may have drifted but would always have each other’s back. The two later addition characters fit perfectly. Their banter and integration with the party felt natural. One of them has a deep and interesting arc and a psyche that makes their presence meaningful without explicit explanation.\n\nIf I have to score it, I give it a 9 out of 10. Being nitpicky, I might say 8.9 out of 10 because I noticed a few odd terrain moments while exploring off the beaten path, such as waterfalls that seemed to end unnaturally on rocks and some jarring asset reuse in a few locations. These issues came up only when I deliberately explored every corner of each level, so they are minor but still present.\n\n[spoiler] I really hope to see where they take this story next. I can easily imagine some characters returning in a follow up but not quite as their former selves, perhaps as figures who inspired their counterparts in that world. One scene stood out as foreshadowing the two factions. Maelle is holding a cake while Verso and Clea stand among others on her left and Gustave and Emma stand on her right with a fairly distinct split between the groups. It made me wonder if Gustave and other characters in the canvas reflect someone Verso or Maelle knew in the real world who might be a part of the Writer faction. The characters we grew to love could become antagonists or at least appear in the next story without being entirely hostile, since Maelle and possibly Verso have a connection with them. [/spoiler]",

This game I play once, as thoroughly as I could, made my decision at the end and was so impacted by the story and its consequences that it literally felt sincerely WRONG to keep playing. For those that have finished it, you'll understand, for those that haven't, not only will you understand but this story will sit rent-free in your head for a long time after you turn it off and you unravel what you've just done. Like Shrek, this thing has layers. My only advice to anyone picking it up for the first time, don't breeze through the dialogue. Sit in it for a bit. The Painters painted a beautiful world, the musicians orchestrated a masterpiece, those FUCKING WRITERS have ruined me for all other games.",

The premise, buildup, characters, setting, twists, cut-scenes, etc. made the story one of the best I've ever experienced from any type of media.\r\n\r\nVisuals: 10/10\r\nHard to believe this game was developed by a relatively small company. Colors, environments, animations, lighting, all of them were so well done.\r\n\r\nGameplay: 9/10\r\nDon't knock the turn-based gameplay until you try it. One of the best, if not the best, in the genre. Perfect blend of skill and comfort for me. Everything felt so fluid. Enemies can get a little repetitive after a long while, and certain builds trivialize endgame, but that may not even pose as a problem for a lot of people.\r\n\r\nOverall: 9.5/10\r\nBest game I've played this year. Deserves GOTY. Will riot if it doesn't win.",

The game's narrative dresses death in a wholly unique fashion through a captivating narrative with well-written complex characters, and that's what resonates with me the most. After all, how do you communicate the unknowable inevitability that—arguably—drives us to do anything at all? \n\nGameplay-wise, I had a lot of fun with the turn-based system, which I wasn't expecting to enjoy because very few reconstructions manage to keep it engaging the entire dang time. The game also gives the player a lot of flexibility in terms of things to do and explore without it straying too far from the central storyline.\n\nI don't want to give away too much because I believe this game is best enjoyed blind. If you're interested in what you see on the Steam page, but still feel a little unsure, I encourage you to jump into the paint, experience this piece of art, and enjoy the ride along the way.",

        "review": "I know I'm months late after beating this game back in June, but I didn't think that I would finally play an indie that surpassed Child of Light as my favorite Indie Game of all time until now. This game is not only the best game I played throughout this entire year, but it's one of the best games that came out this console generation. \n\nThe story is a literary masterpiece that rivals fantasy franchises such as the Lord of the Rings in terms of the characters being very human in personality and going on an epic journey to save a civilization. The gameplay is what modern Final Fantasy should have been where it's still turn-based, but you can do other mechanics such as dodging and parrying attacks. The game's visuals also look very good for an Unreal Engine 5 title where it looks like Dishonored and Bioshock Infinite had a baby to create this game. The music is beautifully atmospheric.\n\nThe only issues are that the mapping system in the game needs some work where the overworld has a proper map when traveling with Esquie, but if you're in a particular world, you're completely on your own trying to figure out where to go (a wave point system would've helped as well). Another issue is how inconsistent the dodging and parrying in combat can be regarding timing to avoid making a mistake. This game is also pretty demanding for mid-range hardware as well where my Razer Blade 17's GPU is directly equivalent to a desktop RTX 3060 Ti and even then, I generally get around 50's-low 60's in FPS at 4K DLSS Performance at Medium settings and the devs should really consider adding FSR and FSR Frame Gen for those whose GPU's are from an older generation that doesn't support DLSS/XeSS Frame Gen. You're only option in that case would be to use software such as OptiScaler or Lossless Scaling to add Frame Gen for those that lack the support. Another issue is the difficulty balance where even at the lowest difficulty, the game's normal/boss fights already feel like it's easier to die pretty quickly in the middle of the game's 1st Act. Trainer mods were basically a necessity to make it easier to beat the entire game on PC. I think if Sandfall scaled the difficulty better in combat, it would be more accessible for the average person to try out.\n\nOther than that, this game is still a masterpiece in every sense of the word, I recommend many people to try this out, and I hope that this wins GOTY at this year's Game Awards.",

        "review": "I'm not one to normally write reviews for games. If I do, they tend to be short or joke reviews, not meant to be taken seriously. Hell, I'm not even the kind of person to go around recommending games to people in general, it's just not my thing.\n\nHOWEVER\nEvery single positive review of this game is true. Every single person calling this game a masterpiece, they're telling the truth. While I do have gripes over the turn-based gameplay/combat, it's leagues better than most other turn-based RPG's I've played and, honestly, the gripes are rather minor for the studios first game. Combat starts off good, enemies are tough but forgiving, and it takes you time to learn the parrying timing, and the builds for characters using pictos and lumina are plentiful and fun. Late game, however, it can turn into a bit of a bummer as you can easily begin to overpower most enemies, including the final boss of the story. \nThat aside, though, everything else about this game is... well, words fail me in trying to capture the sorrow, grief, joy and wonder this game inspires. From the breathtaking landscapes and enemy design that just *look* like beautiful paintings, to the phenomenal soundtrack that to this day has me crying anytime it plays, to the narrative direction and stellar voice acting, the game hits every single aspect with the passion of artists inspired by God himself. \nAnd the story... holy fuck, the story starts off as stated but it will begin to drop hints as to the overall plot here and there until, by the end of Act 2, you are left stunned, shocked, mouth agape as they reveal each major plot point that's been hidden in plain site the entire time. It gets to the point where every single word delivered by the characters have so much weight and meaning behind them that I, personally, had to pause after each sentence just to make sure I was processing the MOUNTAINS of information beind dumped over the course of minutes. But not just the grand reveal, the story captures and immerses you in the world of our cast, and you end up falling in love with each of the characters, learning who they are, their ambitions, goals, attitudes, life stories, they're all so fleshed out that they feel like REAL people, and when shit starts happening to them in game that relationship you build up with them comes in and hits you hard, and it gets harder and harder as the story goes on and you learn the truth of everything. It's so moving, so heart wrenching, that it will leave you in tears long after you set down your controller and turn off the game. \nThis game has touched me. It has moved me, and I have never felt so seen and heard by any piece of media in my life. This game's story has helped me heal old trauma I thought I had let go of. I feel as if the writers knew my story, and wanted to tell me \"We hear you, we see you. We understand, and we're here for you.\" I cannot express accurately in words what that means to me, but I hope that the people who read this review will understand what it means because I can't explain it without spoiling the entire plot lol\n\nEssentially, what I'm trying to say is that this game is, in essence, a love letter. It is a love letter to art, to artistic expression, the creative process. It is a love letter to the artist, to the gamer, to humanity and everyone who has an expressive, creative heart. It is an ode to what makes art, art. If you are a creative person, if you like deep, narrative-driven stories, if you want to feel your heart ripped out and put back in along with a sense of catharsis that will leave you with a weeks-long emotional high, if you've ever created something as a way of expressing yourself, then you will fall in love with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33",

        "review": "I'm going to list out my thoughts here and get right to it...\n\nCons:\n- Mo-cap jank: Model clipping (such as the rose Gustave holds) or unrealistic item handling (the cup full of wine being thrown around by Gustave but somehow he still has wine left) in cut-scenes can detract from the immersion, especially when everything else is working so much in its favour.\n- Facial animations/expression outside of cut-scenes are non existent: Especially noticeable in attack animations making what should be a dramatic and dire situation seem quite goofy.\n-Attack effects/Rope effects are quite excessive: The FX often explode over the models in a glossy distorted manner often compiling on each other and looking messy. Whilst the attacks are all incredibly hype, I do wish I could see the artistry in them with more controlled and relevant FX overlays. Most enemy attacks don't suffer this problem it is mainly the player characters.\n-Not a good game for game beginners: not a huge downside but the game does make a lot of assumptions on your knowledge of video game mechanics in general, this makes sense for a game that pays homage to so many RPGs of old, but I can understand the frustration of those unfamiliar.\n\nPros:\n-Great pacing: Both narratively and mechanically I felt a flow through till the beginning of the third act. Never quite getting stumped but always having a challenge and a sense of direction\n-Movie quality cut-scenes: Aside from jank mentioned before, performance and script is crafted and delivered beautifully alongside a heart tugging soundtrack\n-Fun gameplay: Arguably the most important part of any game. The parry system is a rewarding skill to learn, abilities and skills bring a variety of strategy. And with a dramatic flourish attacks hit with a punch against your enemies or right back at you.\n-Beautiful art direction: While i can see where some criticism in its shiny UNREAL ENGINE appearance, the different locations in the game and enemy designs ooze character whilst matching elegantly with the themes of clair obscur.\n\nA wonderfully told heartfelt story, that you can't pull yourself away from. An instant classic\n",

        "review": "My simplified results will be at the bottom of this, so I'll start by saying, thius game its fine. I have two issues on this story (because the story is unique, no game on this year's game awards,  including \"Red Riding Hood Beetle\" or \"She/her Hades\" and \"Stranded To death by Too Much Cardio 2\" got this level of story) And the game style for me its kind of whatever because i do no play this type of turn base but the narrative, the vibe, the music, and the style trumps it, and that speaks volumes AND the story mode helps.\n\n[GAMEPLAY]\nThe story mode difficulty is hard… imagine the normal one. God forbit a brother just be trying to enjoy the vibes. Granted, most of my gameplay was a Sonic game trying to go past the enemies, and that ultimately didnt let me level up, but we cant confirm for sure, its a hunch…\n\nSparring mechanics became the ultimate heartsopper, i kept trying to figure out what the f#ck am i looking at, if it was a leg, or an arm… or a vulva? Unpredictable hits every time, these enemies need more coordination on how to hit and be less flamboyant about it (which im fine by it, we gotta keep in mind this is a French game and its a different culture, but i also didnt see a lot of hijabs if this was INSPIRED by france)\n \n[STORY]\nHere is the cream of the crop, the STORY. Unpredictable, surreal, odd, but flawed, but dont worry, because i’ll tell you the TWO issues\n\n-Issue #1\nThe story deals around mourning, letting go of loved ones, the conflict that happens: either to cope with the person you loved, or continue with your live. There are also subtle touches of guilt and family relations, all established on this fantastical environment. I personaly cant relate to the characters, the topics at hand are one dimensional and frankly i cant relate, humph pumph\n\n-Issue #2 (Spoilers)\nThey KILLLED my goat Gustav. This is unbelievable, these pieces of dookie Croissant devs introduced us with gustav, in this beautiful world, and showed him saying his last goodbye to his GF, and at that moment I realized -I am Gustav. He is me, he got a cool mustache, and he is equally as insecure on this dirty world as me. F#ck, he was a good person, he even made a little Journal “For those who come after”, i used to stop for 10 minutes hearing the journal music, taking it in. After all we went through, all of the sudden he gets KILLED…. Like a DOOOOOOG. MY GOOOOOAOAT did NOOOOOT had to die. I am now empty, i cant eat, i only watch the loading screen of the youtube vids in silence, because i only hear the deafening sounds of the humming from our Journal sessions… Oh Gustav. And not only that, after the big reveal, that we found out that we can revive people, we found that the only person that cant be saved was Gustav, F#UCK man, c0ck teasing me like that.AND on top of that AFTER the big reveal, we find out that our goals and dreams were for nothing… NOTHING. Gustav died like a dog, for NOTHING. Next time i see a French person im gonna remember them “Where were you, when Gustav fell”. I bet these stupid game devs are rolling over the idea of making me as the main character and die for nothing. I cannot understand. AND THEN… AND THEN they swap him for Gustav Zero Sugar, aka Verso (he is fine character, I guess). But imagine going to work and seeing another person at your desk and he says “oh you didnt know?” My summer is ruined, i got ptsd when i hear french, and i cant journal anymore.\n\n[CONCLUSION]\nFine game. 8/10",

It made me rush the main story a little to fast cause i felt like i could do them if i did one more mission. But then u beat the game and u are still too low of a lvl to do them .. \r\n\r\n\r\nBest Part - Story writing \r\nThe story and characters got me so hooked . also just the art style of the game is very captivating and makes every monster, every Boss and encounters super engaging.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Artstyle takes you to different dimension but it's the music that makes this game a pleasure even when there are some low budget issues. Game is simply a breath of fresh air, of bold ideas synergized with very well known gaming patterns. I felt like a child visiting a crazy playground where every game was about learning new things. Truly worth it's price and I can't even imagine how to beat such a strong entrance by Sandfall Interactive.\n\nSome problems I've encountered are bugs requiring reloading (autosaves are plenty), some frustrating plants and invisible walls that make exploration a hit or miss (be amazed or be stuck in some bush). Some other features that kind of explain the price are very not balanced attributes/weapons/skills system - if you have some experience this game will be trivial and loot is shown as red or white light on the ground - predictable but I felt like going back to Dark Souls, this game is so artistic that such loot system and presentation seems very ordinary.\n\nPlayable on 1650GTX, not bad without controller. Not 10/10, but easily 8/10. Maybe 8,5 for innovations and style.",

No.\nIt is however one of the closest games i have ever played to being it.\n\nThe story is gutwrenching, every single environment is jawdropping, the music is fantastic, it has funny moments, it has moments that make you cry til’ you can't anymore and it has exploration that feels extremely rewarding with combat that feels skill based and fun.\n\nI can not recommend this game enough and I am so glad I walked into it with the only knowledge of it being “kinda turnbased but not really”.\n\nSo why not give it a perfect score? What deluded the gameplay for me?\n\nWell, honestly just nitpicks. The game's performance is not the greatest. Even with my kinda decent computer the fps goes down to 18 at times and I never saw it go over 55 at any time. Of course, I played on the highest settings and I did not care that much but it is still a small problem.\n\nThe difficulty curve is a little funky as well I think. At the start the game is pretty hard and every now and then you run into some really hard enemies [spoiler] (the chromatic ones) [/spoiler] but you scale kinda fast and at a certain point i kinda just one shot everything [spoiler] (the axons took two turns each tbf) [/spoiler] but a little later the game flipped again and i did basically 0 damage to any non basic enemy i found and everything oneshot me instead. It was a bit staggering to encounter the switch [spoiler] (even if it was at the start of act 3) [/spoiler].\n\nBut honestly, that's about all the “bad” that I can come up with. The game is phenomenal and has climbed near the top of my favorite game’s list.\n\nI highly recommend it, even if just for the story.\n\n[h1] 9.8/10 [/h1]",

I was initially reluctant to purchase this game, I usually wait for sales, and even then I have a gigantic backlog to get through before I can start to justify purchasing games. This one was overwhelmingly recommended to me as well as compelled to try based on the sheer amount of buzz surrounding it. This is one of the few exceptions that I would go for a game at full price.\n\nYou know the game is something special when you're crying over a digital character you JUST met while starting the game 20 minutes in.\n\nThe storytelling, the atmosphere, the depth, the music, it's a wonderful masterpiece of a game.\n\nThere's plenty of moments where I just sit and have to think, not because of problem solving, but because I had to sit and mentally process certain events.\n\nAlmost every moment in the game is screenshot worthy, to an absurd point where you're blowing up your screenshot page in your profile to overwhelming percentages of just Clair Obscur.\n\nNot only that, but this game perfectly presents how the gaming industry isn't lead by the big companies. 30ish developers left Ubisoft and made this, what I would consider, the game of the decade for me.\n\nBuy it, and enjoy it.\nOne piece of advise, don't min/max. Play the game through normally as intended, don't look up guides, don't do every single side quest until later in the game. Play through on normal difficulty and play the story first. You'll thank me later.",

Forced upscaling because the game is unoptimized, which in turn makes it look like a blurry mess. Game looks like it was made 5 years ago, is extremely simplistic in terms of combat, menus etc. The dialogue can be cringe. No manual save option, only auto save. Game of the year my ass.",

It doesn't seem like build choices make a big difference in the combat.\r\nAt 13 hours in, the story is still mysterious and the world building is weird. I guess at this point my boredom with the gameplay has overcome the little interest I had in the story.\r\n\r\nDialogue is solid, visuals are nice, music has been forgettable so far.",

How tf do you have a gardener?\n\nOops, my bad. Anyway, after hearing everyone rave about it, I bought this masterpiece. I was so excited to play.\n\nBut then I realized… my crush doesn’t own a copy. And honestly, it felt wrong to enjoy such beauty without her. So, I decided to wait.\n(Yes, very chivalrous… or very stupid of me. Can’t decide.)\n\nStill waiting though 🫣.\n\nFrom what I’ve heard, it’s an amazing game. Definitely recommend. 🦋",

However, being able to effectively execute dodging and parries has become something that feels rewarding with this game. This will be a game that I definitely play more than once.",

Plot twists and turns you won't see coming and hit you like a truck. An interesting and beautiful world with diverse environments to explore. Side quests, mini-games, the works. And the music... It's just top-notch. \r\n\r\nIt has a fresh take on turn-based combat that keeps you engaged and is very satisfying with all the different builds and team comps you can play around with. Truly an experience that sticks with you. \r\n\r\nThe fact that this was made by a small team is amazing and a breath of fresh air in an industry filled with regurgitated slop and monetization systems from hell. \r\n\r\nMy only criticism would be how one or two story beats are wrapped up a bit hastily. And it's a bit too easy to over-level, making certain fights a cakewalk. But honestly, those are minor gripes compared to the whole package.\r\n\r\nGOTY 2025!",

A story of resilience, that shows how human ingenuity and determination to survive can overcome impossible odds. Not just the characters forming your party, but also those met around the world or described in the numerous lore files from previous expeditions, exude character and uniqueness, no matter how big or small their role may be, or have been. Narratively, it’s a masterpiece that knows exactly when to turn the tables, thwart the pacing, move it up, or surprise you with the unthinkable. There are very few, if any, narrative faults or plot holes; an achievement for a tale of this complexity, and a testament to how a bunch of Frenchmen in a basement could write a story that vastly surpasses 99% of the entire industry. Visually, the world is nothing short of amazing. I stopped more than a few times admiring the scenery, with its captivating ambiance that is a mix of fantasy post-apocalypse and Hayao Miyazaki acid-tripping through the Shire. You’ll definitely get shivers from it, as its architecture constantly shows you how small your party, and humanity’s remnants in general are, in comparison to the lethal forces they struggle against. \n\n[h3]Exploration & Secrets[/h3]\nThe map of Clair Obscur is divided into dozens of self-contained areas, dotted around a massive open-world. Some of them are small, others sprawling and multi-layered, with dozens of optional and hidden areas often housing unique weapons, upgrades, abilities and bosses. At first, you’ll be limited in what you can access, but as you progress, more features and mobility upgrades allow you to access more, and often harder ones. Combing every nook and cranny is rewarding, as it will directly influence your party’s combat capabilities, and allow you to gather unique items used for quests. In a world like this, so alien and yet familiar in some aspects, you’ll never know what to expect after the next jump, climb or fall. It never gets boring or repetitive in this aspect, but instead, you crave for the next unique ability or weapon nested in a remote corner, or the next tremendous boss to test your might against. The amount of secrets, some more convoluted than others, will be the joy of attentive explorers. The lack of a world-spanning fast travel option can get a little annoying, at least until late-game, but it’s never a deal-breaking issue because of cleverly-placed shortcuts.\n\n[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]\nThe crown jewel. Even if at first Clair Obscur might look like your run-of-the-mill JRPG, that couldn’t be farther from the truth. Instead of a traditional turn-based approach that translates in a trade of blows, and focuses on skill order alone, this game will have you actively dodge, parry, shoot and QTE your way to get most things done. In theory, you can parry everything if your timing is good enough, and open up to powerful counter attacks. In practice, this is hard, with a parry window worthy of the most difficult Souls games, and enemies that can muster from 2-3 to even more than a dozen different attack patterns. Learning each of them until you master the timing is the fundamental mechanic against the toughest bosses, as is knowing what their weak spots are to shoot them with your guns and gain advantages. On the hardest setting, missing even a single dodge or parry, especially in later phases, usually means instant death for a character or even the entire party. Unless you instant kill your enemies first, which becomes possible later on, with the ridiculous amount buffs you’ll be able to stack.\n\nPractice makes perfect, and it couldn’t be more true. A plethora of status effects, weaknesses, resistances and dozens of unique abilities that synergize with each other, on top of completely different combat mechanics for every party member, allow a degree of depth rarely seen in this genre. Most bosses in your path will feel like a true challenge, and some even have multiple phases, rolling you back to the first should your party fall at any point. The spectacle of animations, effects, clever slow-mos and particles only adds further weight and emphasis to a combat system that would already be excellent on its own.\n\n[h3]Character Progression[/h3]\nBy roaming the world, defeating stronger foes and leveling up, you’ll be able to acquire skill points to invest in new abilities for each character, and Lumina points, used to grant powerful passive abilities derived from the Pictos you also find in the same way. These have an enormous range of effects, be them defensive, offensive, or support. This system allows you to fine-tune the role and purpose of each party member on the field, and when summed up with all the other effects from abilities and weapons, gives a huge variety of combinations to experiment with. The only flaw in all this is that Lumina is a finite resource, at least until much later, so only three of your five total party members will be the ones to invest all of them into.",

For me, that singular boss left me on a sour note in an otherwise fantastic game. I really dislike when games have bosses that require cheese builds; I didn't use Maelle the whole game and suddenly I'm forced to make specific builds to beat this ridiculously over-tuned and, frankly, torturous boss? No thanks. You have a \"reserve team\" that the game never really requires you to use up until that point, so I focused on the characters I enjoyed and was punished for it. If I can beat every boss in the game up until the very end, the challenge bosses at the end should be difficult but still feasible with the builds that I've used up until that point. Basically, I really don't like when games require specific party members and cheese builds to beat a boss rather than using the build/party combinations that I've worked on throughout the game. It took a lot of joy and sense of progression out of the game for me sadly. Luckily, the fact that it's an optional boss means I can still highly recommend the game, but it was still super disappointing.",

I bough this game despite watching MULTIPLE videos of people playing through the entire game just because i wanted to experience it myself. \nevery twist every plot point was incredible. and while there are moments that i personally have critiques about this game is as close to perfection as i can think. and the endings while i have MY side and opinion on which is the \"right one\" is so up for debate and discussion on which actually is the right choice.\n\nThis is a 9.8/10 for me and a must play and must experience in video games. this is how video games SHOULD be made.",

What's this game's often repeated selling point - art style - is also its biggest weakness. Combat is bad, even though the game tries to innovate on the turn-based combat formula - but ultimately fails. How do you fight a giant upright wagon with random pointy sticks? In a game where combat is all about dodging, how do you dodge an artistic version of a random inanimate object with random silly bits shooting at you? It's not impossible, but it's not exactly an engaging gameplay.\r\n\r\nUnlike with more or less humanoid figures, you have no way of knowing which part shoots, which part hits, walks... Unless you play the same encounter 33 times or use a stopwatch for every move your opponent makes. And so combat becomes either a question of dumb luck or redoing the more difficult fights so many times you learn them by heart or just somehow muddle through.\r\n\r\nEnemies don't telegraph their attacks in any way, the UI (once again, art over substance and functionality) doesn't show any info on them except health - even though the game relies heavily on weaknesses, status effects, buffs and debuffs, which can dramatically boost your damage output. You often run into enemies with heavy damage reduction, which are just ridiculous bullet sponges - unless you do something specific to break the resistance. Which, again, is not indicated in any way on the enemy or in the game's UI.\r\n\r\nThe whole skills interface is a convoluted mess and you will waste time trying to figure out how stuff activates, moves between different slots, etc.\r\n\r\nWhile the game looks nice, tries to do a refresh of the very traditional turn-based combat formula and puts lots of emphasis on story, the gameplay just doesn't deliver and the confusing and unclear combat is too much of a bother to continue playing. Pushing the artistic angle at the detriment of gameplay is a bad choice.",

Even after i got the 100%, it left me wanting more. \r\n\r\nExpedition 33 has something that a lot of games are missing today: compelling characters and a beautiful  world building with a unique game play loop that makes you realize why you got hooked on playing video games in the first place. \r\nThe passion that the developers clearly shows and is such a breath of fresh air from most generic corporate AAA slop being pushed out today. \r\n\r\nMy only complaint is that I wish i could experience the story for the first time again.  \r\nGame of the Year 100%!",

        "review": "I've played countless games in my life. You begin to see the patterns—the echoes and motifs that rhyme across genres and generations. It has become exceptionally rare to find an experience that feels genuinely novel.\r\n\r\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33 is that rare experience. It is a masterclass in design, composing its elements into something that feels utterly new. The visuals look like a living painting, the score is unforgettable, and the story is mature and refreshingly original. This is all anchored by an addictive and strategic combat system that is deeply customizable and respects the player's intelligence. While each part is excellent, their true magic is how they are woven together into a seamless, unique experience that leaves a lasting impression.\r\n\r\nWhere the experience falters, however, is on the technical front. Performance can be inconsistent, and the game needs a bit more polish to run smoothly across all hardware. There are other oddities in the game that, while mods thankfully exist to address, seem odd to exist at all; for instance, cutscenes play at 30fps, rather than 60fps, which feels jarring when going from gameplay to story moments. However, the developers appear actively invested in improving the experience, which inspires confidence that these issues will be officially addressed in time.\r\n\r\nIn a medium full of familiar rhymes, Clair Obscur is a bold, original voice. It breaks the rhythm we've grown accustomed to and proves that there are still new stories to be told and new ways to tell them. If you've been waiting for something to truly surprise you, your expedition ends here.",

The storytelling even for me that i skip story in most games caught me at the fist moment, every time something happened i wanted to know the lore about it. Gameplay wise i love RPG specially turned-based, so to me it felt like i just found diamonds, there are a variaty of build in each character, multiple combinations and i enjoyed every moment of it. The thing that caught me the most was the soundtracks and music of the game, every track transmit emotions and capture you at the moment. This game feels that a gamer made it, that loves what they do and transmit it to their product. I recommend 100% playing  it even if you dont like turned-based games like the majority of people does, let yourself take an opportunity to live such beautiful moments that this piece of art gives you. Tomorrow comes...\r\n\r\n(sorry if my english is bad, not my native language)",

The story slaps until Act 3, where things go well off the rails and there's no obvious order to the things you should do (and if you guess wrong, you get oneshot). The UI/menus could really use work - this game desperately needs character loadouts so you can swap characters between solo dps, team dps, and support builds. The characters are mostly likable, but there's some character development that turns into regression that I reaaaally did not like, and it retroactively soured my opinion of the story. It's all still worth playing for the soundtrack alone, though.",

        "review": "[h1] Absolute Cinema [/h1]\n\nI was hesitant of getting the game due to how hyped it was, but it did not disappoint. From it coming out of nowhere to being one of the top reviewed games of all time, I would be shocked if it didn't get GOTY. \n\n[h2] The Good [/h2]\n\n[list]\n    [*]The gameplay is fantastic. The fusion of traditional turn-based combat with a skill-based parry system works swimmingly. It's incredibly engaging, and I hope more games adopt this style. I struggled with parrying at first until learning there was an audio cue that I couldn't hear when streaming to my TV. Once I switched to by PC and its speakers, I could clearly hear it and had a much better experience.\n\n    [*]The soundtrack is phenomenal. Easily one of the best I've ever heard.\n\n    [*]The story was wild and unpredictable. I never knew what was about to happen, and the actors' performances were top tier. One of the most original stories we've had in a long time.\n[/list]\n\n[h2] The Not-So-Good [/h2]\n\nWith how praised the game is, it was hard for me to find legitimate criticisms before I bought it, so here's what I had issues with:\n\n[list]\n    [*]The movement is kinda janky. Overall, it's fine, but there are platforming sections and parkour challenges (think Chained Together). Those can be annoying when your character decides to roll off an edge or not read a jump input.\n\n    [*]The game took from the Black Myth: Wukong school of design when it came to invisible walls. Some areas have visually open spaces that are inaccessible for no reason. \n\n    [*]The fog/lighting was a little dramatic, and I would have trouble seeing sometimes. Most of the game looks fantastic and like a painting. However, there were certain areas where it got to be a bit much. My screen would get washed out from the fog, or it would be near pitch black. In some of the dark areas, your characters would pull out a lantern to light it up, and in others, they wouldn't for some reason? \n[/list]\n\n[h2] The Bad [/h2]\n\nIt's UE5, so performance is not the best. While static scenes look great, lots of motion or particles can create shimmering due to the anti-aliasing. I also had to run the game on medium settings with a 60 fps cap in order to not crash. I never found the root of the crashing as my GPU temps and power draws all looked okay. For context, my specs are:\n\nCPU - i7-11700K\nGPU - RTX 4070\nRAM - 32GB\n\nThe game ran perfectly fine at high settings, but it would give a \"Fatal Error\" message and close after 10-15 minutes. \n\n[h2] Overall [/h2]\n\nThe game is great, especially at the price point. As long as you can get it to not crash, you'll have a good time.",

Coincidentally enough, I learned from an interview that the director's favorite game growing up is FF series. Well, congratulations to him and the dev team because they truly made a game, dare I say, a game comparably to some of the best FF entries, but exceeding them in varies aspects.\n\nThe rest of the review has little to none spoilers:  \n[spoiler]From my past reading experience, with pocket universe settings like this game, the \"god\" is always cold and cruel while this game makes me feel like we are probably not that lonely and feeble in the vast and sometimes inconceivable universe. With love, care and inspiration for art, it's not that bad of an existence as a specie.[/spoiler] We have the chance to experience master piece story like this. Me happy!!! *turkey noise*",

        "review": "I bought this game despite sort of knowing I wouldn't like it, mainly because I'd watched a few reviews that made me think it wouldn't be up my alley. However, it's difficult to ignore games that are rated \"overwhelmingly positive\" on Steam so I decided to give it a go.\n\nA few seconds after starting, I was already annoyed by the developer's message suggesting I plug in my \"controller.\" First of all, you sold this to a PC gamer on Steam, and so I assume you realize that there are PC gamers who will not use or have controllers. The game plays fine on a keyboard and mouse, but don't tell me how to enjoy your game.\n\nThe game itself starts out very slow and artistic, with long scenes of meloncholic views at the horizon, which sets the stage for the plot. The plot is revealed very slowly over the coming hours as you explore. The plot itself seems interesting enough and there's a certain curiosity to continue playing it. But after 12 hours I feel that there is unlikely a redemption arc coming that would change my review to positive.\n\nFor me, what sells a game to a gamer is whether the gameplay itself is worthwhile. And while the scenery is beautiful, the gameplay just falls short of being enjoyable. The complete lack of a map forces this sort of old school exploration that requires you to check every nook and cranny to find goodies, more often finding enemies that force you into a fight.\n\nWhich brings us to the combat. The game reminds me a lot of Nier:Automata where you're wandering around trying to explore areas and getting into combat now and then, but the above mentioned game is at least live action so you can run away or finish the fights quickly. Expedition 33 requires you to go into turn-based combat, the mechanics of which are reminiscent of Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy from the 1980s. You basically select \"attack\" or \"skill\" or \"use item\" or run away. To use such ancient game mechanics felt like a really poor choice.\n\nAs well, in what is a weird sort of merge between the Quicktime Event (QTE) games like Sekiro and Dark Souls genre and the aforementioned Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy mechanics of \"you go and then I go and then you go and then I go,\" this game allows you to avoid all damage if your reflexes are fast enough. So you can't simply say this game is a tribute to old school gaming, since it rewards QTE gamers more than those of us whose reflexes are long gone.\n\nI began losing interest in the game when I started meeting some of the NPCs, who have similarly weird and meaningless dialogue like Nier:Automata, but also seem to be some kind of take on Despicable Me's Minions. They have silly voices and sillier quests, many of which are simply to get various cosmetic tweaks.\n\nOverall, I fail to see why this game is anything more than a 6/10, but it may be a generational or genre divide that I don't understand. I can see the merits of the game in some respects but the tedium of the combat, the silliness of the Gestrals, the poor map and HUD options and overstylized melodramatic cutscenes just didn't grab me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The world is gorgeous but exploration can become a chore with no map or other indicator of where the heck you're going. (Even a compass in the overworld, please.) The characters and lore are incredibly rich but there are certain elements of the story that completely undermine the player's experience and I don't know if the writers truly understood the implications of those narrative choices. The soundtrack is one of the best game soundtracks of recent years (and honestly, of all time). The ending will stay with me for a while, I think.\n\nIt's a great game that has issues - so, in other words, a great game. I can't wait to see what Sandfall does next. I hope whatever it is has heaps and heaps of QOL and UX improvements though 🙏",

Incredible narrative and worldbuilding that always keeps you guessing, and absolutely worth playing through at least twice to catch all the subtle hints you wouldn't have caught the first time through. Every single thing in this game feels handcrafted and deliberate. The combat system makes this feel almost more like an action game than an RPG - think Paper Mario meets Sekiro (though the parrying is stricter than the latter for sure).\r\n\r\nMy ONLY gripe is the act 3 and post-game scaling, because by that point if you've been paying attention to the core mechanics, you'll be pumping out insane damage numbers. I was told 2 things going into act 3: beeline the story and do side content after the credits, and DO NOT use the new Pictos they hand you at the start of act 3 until post-game. I followed that advice and it made it a much better experience.",

        "review": "I started this game expecting it to be one of the best of 2025. Fast forward to today, when I beat it for the first time (will probably play it again) and not only has it surpassed all of my expectations, it has become my favorite game of all time:\n\n[h3] Technical aspect / graphics [/h3]\nThe weakest point of the game. It's UE5, so get ready for noisy global illumination and shadows, blurry presentation all throughout, noticeable pop-in and a poor optimization that requires upscaling on an average mid-high end system. \n\n[h3] Art direction [/h3]\nAbsolutely beautiful. It is a masterpiece in every sense. The character and enemy designs, the use of different colours and aspect ratios for certain scenes, the \"flow\" of the visual effects, the creativity in the different sceneries, every single detail you can think of is carefully placed and with a clear purpose behind it. Aside from a handful of moments, you basically forget about all the technical issues because of how breathtaking everything looks.\n\n[h3] Music [/h3]\nIt's a masterpiece. You can go listen to it right now on youtube or spotify if you don't believe me. Just don't listen to the lyrics, especially if you know french, because they are full of spoilers.\n\n[h3] Exploration [/h3]\nVery solid. Exploration is relatively contained, but the lack of a map makes it engaging. You really feel like an expeditioner discovering new things in a mostly unknown world, and the game rewards you with currency to upgrade your gear, new weapons and pictos (stuff that gives you different buffs), some side quests and harder bosses that give you even better rewards. Almost all of the side content contributes to the world-building. For instance, without giving any spoilers, you can find out what happened to previous expeditions and what they discovered.\n\n[h3] Combat [/h3]\nIn a word, it is challenging. It's turn-based, but the enemies hit hard. The game has dodge and parry mechanics, the first being easier and the second giving you a chance to counter-attack. I played on expert difficulty, and most enemies would kill me in 1-3 hits, so I took my time to learn the parry timings. This is what made me like the combat so much: I usually don't like turn-based combat because I just have to wait until the enemy plays its turn and hope my character doesn't die. With the parries, I can actually do something, and the punishing timings reward you with some extra damage if you succeed. It's very engaging and fun. On top of that, you also have a lot of freedom when it comes to build variety (one-shot, shooter, parry-only, high hp for more survivability, low hp for more damage, and so on),\n\n[h3] Story and characters [/h3]\nThis is by far the best aspect of the game. It hooks you from the very introduction, even before you get to start the adventure. You really feel for the characters and want them to succeed in their goals and aspirations. The pacing of the story is excellent too: just when you think you are figuring things out based on the breadcrumbs the game gives you, the plot takes unexpected turns that keep you enganged from beginning to end. I have to admit that the story made me cry. A LOT.\n\n[h3] Verdict [/h3]\nIf you read everything above, you know the only thing I didn't like is the issues with UE5. Everything else was basically perfect, which is even crazier when you remember this is Sandfall's first game ever. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is the best game of 2025, and my personal favorite of all time. 10/10",

        "review": "I expected nothing going into this game. I remember seeing 1 trailer during some summer event, found it much like the rest of the games visually and only keyed in when I saw it was turn based. I wishlisted it on a whim and when the game came out, I purchased it. I didn't know at the time I'd not only be playing my personal Game of the Year but also one of my top 10 favorite games of all time. \n\nThere is not a single aspect of this game I would change. Every single detail artistically, musically, acting wise, visual design, story, is absolutely phenomenal. This game is absolutely not lacking in praise, but, I'd be remiss if I didn't leave my own thoughts as a review. Not since Nier Automata have I been so blindsided by a game's emotional tone, being lured in by the strange and attractive and stunlocked by the gutwrenching turns every chapter. Every time I felt that I had the game figured out, I was reminded I wasn't giving it enough credit. After the start of Chapter 3, I actually considered not finishing the game. I felt like perhaps they had taken a turn in the story I didn't like and I didn't appreciate the big reveal nor how the main character was acting. I pushed through narratively (because the gameplay was never a chore) and what I saw unfold was a huge middle finger to myself that once again said \"Why did you not trust me on this?\" and such a phenomenal conclusion to the game that I could even feel it seared into my brain for the rest of my life. \n\nOn the off chance anyone reads this, not sure if you should get this game, amidst the 60k+ other reviews, let me just say that this experience is a beautiful love letter to games that inspired it, something very close to the hearts of the developers, and something that will affect games and game design in the industry for a long time. This game does not erase any predecessor, but rather uplifts them, and says \"please, take a look at where we came from!\" \n\nPlay this game. You will not regret it.",

        "review": "One of the best games of the year straight up. It only has one weak point. The game opens so well in what seems like a peaceful world, and then it gets dark very fast. There are so many moments of foreshadowing throughout the game that you only realize as the story unfolds and especially on a second playthrough. That is when you truly notice all the hints about certain characters and events. Truly a fantastic story. You can easily get lost in this game for several hours. I have personally completed it twice, once up to Act 2, and this time on Steam I finished it all the way.\n\nStory: The story starts off almost peaceful, only for you to realize that you actually live in a dark and twisted world, especially with the Paintress and everything that happens. It is a solid 10/10, and I rarely rate games that high, but this one absolutely deserves it. When you let devs cook, this is what comes out of the oven. There is so much clever foreshadowing that once you reach the end, you will have that WTF, how did I not notice this sooner moment.\n\nMusic: 10/10. Nothing more to add.\n\nCombat: Turn based, so if that is not usually your thing, give it a try anyway. Any OG Final Fantasy fan will love this. The only thing I truly dislike is the lack of a minimap. The devs said it was meant to make you immerse yourself and feel like part of the expedition, but by the time you reach the endgame, it just gets annoying not knowing where you have been or what you have already explored. That is not immersion, that is frustration.",

I really hope this doesn’t become an industry standard. Very poor choice.\r\n\r\nLevel design is bad. There are no iconic landmarks, and after battles you’ll often get confused about which way you came from. Sometimes you can jump down certain areas, but other times you’re blocked by invisible walls  super inconsistent.\r\n\r\nThe characters are horribly written. Spoiler warning: there are many situations where the party could’ve just asked, “why the hell did this happen?” but they never do until it’s too late. And when it finally is, they hilariously blame the very person they should’ve been questioning earlier.",

When I tell you that it both is art and examines art on more levels than you'd expect, I'm not sure what that would mean to you. When I tell you that it's both very silly and very dark, and more emotionally rich than you might expect from the intro level, it's hard to convey that and do it justice. So let me say this:\r\n- The art in all its various forms, the visuals, the music, the narrative are all magnificent, and will move anyone with a soul. You will feel a broad gamut of emotions.\r\n- The combat is elegant and challenging in a rewarding way. I don't tend to go for intense mechanical challenges like in a Soulslike or a JRPG. But this game marries both and has increased my tolerance for such an experience, because it's fun. Certain combat things called pictos you collect might overwhelm your menus at some point in a very inelegant way, but they also provide a massive amount of variety, potential replay value, and straight up shenanigans.\r\n- If you love a good mystery, then you'll enjoy piecing this one together. The pacing is very good. And you will be left theorizing, and speculating, and discussing in that way that great stories and art pieces make you do.\r\nSo if you love a good story, a good mystery, a sense of wonder and exploration, and fun combat (that you can make infinitely easier or harder for the most part, to your taste), you should pick up Clair Obscur: Expedition 33",

The story is a fresh perspective on dark fantasy. My one gripe is the fact it portrays the French as a likable people which almost kills the game for me",

Apparently other folks have it worse. \r\n\r\nI really do not enjoy the reaction time system (Parry, Dodge), especially how critical it is to game elements. It lacks an indicator for most enemy attacks and all of the enemies moves are fake-outs so you have to memorize every enemy attack pattern to be effective. The timing is super counter-intuitive so I had to watch a youtube to learn about the sound cues.\r\n\r\nGame is more or less a movie with some turn-battle bits in between. The story is good and the music is great. Art is mostly pretty impressive. Platforming is dog doo with clunky movement and invisible walls. Voice lines are well done and most dialogue is voice-over. Male characters look cookie-cutter.\r\n\r\n4/10. Not my jam.",

Areas loop back on themselves in ways that feel artificially confusing rather than cleverly designed. It creates tedium instead of exploration.\r\n\r\nCombat System: While the game seems to aim for Soulslike or character action depth, the combat falls short. You're essentially limited to blocking and dodging with little room for experimentation or skill expression. It becomes monotonous quickly compared to the genre standards it's trying to emulate.\r\n\r\nRPG Elements: The build system lacks depth. Unlike other roguelikes or RPGs where distinct builds define your playstyle, nothing here feels memorable or impactful enough to encourage different approaches.\r\n\r\nBottom Line: Great presentation can't compensate for repetitive gameplay loops and shallow systems. \r\n\r\nI don't recommend",

I definitely 100% recommend the game for anyone who likes story driven RPG games. I consider it a must play. Although its a turn based kind of game but they took that idea and made it into a better fighting system for that genre which made the fighting system sooo much fun.\r\n\r\nSorry for the long unorganized review but I really like the game :)",

If you enjoy beautiful worlds, wonderful music, or incredible characters there is something for you here.  If you enjoy turn-based JRPG-style combat there is something for you here in the offensive side battle system.  If you enjoy western real-time combat there is something for you here in the defensive side of the battle system.  If you enjoy customizing and synergizing character builds there is enormous depth here.  The story is the best I've experienced in any media in a long, long time - a tale of love and grief you shouldn't miss out on.  Do yourself a favor, play this game.\n\nI only really have one small critique of what I would still consider a 10/10 game.  The next time out I'd like them to work a bit on signposting and progress tracking indications.  In this 50+ hour open world experience it can get very difficult to know where you've been, what you've found, and what you're ready to face.  That's not all bad - it provides some mystique, but there's probably a happy middle ground between a map full of Ubisoft-style markers and nothing.  Subtle art and label changes for instance, would go a long way.",

The story is an absolute masterpiece, both being gut wrenching at times and joyful with moments that make you smile. The graphics are absolutely stunning on highest settings and the cinematics really suck you in. In most games i play i'll usually skip one or two cutscenes but in this game i didn't skip anything and went out of my way to read every single line of dialogue. The music in this game is on another level, it is so captivating and emotional and being able to understand the lyrics gives an awesome perspective! Last but not least the gameplay mecanics are the most fun and challenging I've ever encountered in a turn-based game, have those quick-time events and having to parry makes you want to get better at the game.\nOverall i would highly recommend you give this game a try and if you can't due to monetary or hardware issues, please just take some time to watch all the cutscenes on youtube, it will be worth your time!",

If i could wipe my mind again and play it again for the third time, I would do it again! The music is so unique for each area, game style feeds like you're a boss when nailing a perfect counter-parry with no hits. The story is one of a kind, I hope this gets GOTY, don't get me wrong there are great games this year! I played and finished Ghost of Yotei, Death Stranding 2, Split Fiction (unique for sure), watched game play for Silk Song, but these games you can predict the story line throughout the entire time, this one was different, it was interesting the entire time and was perfect when it comes to everything. Lastly, the music was so beautiful, enough that I learned to play some of the songs on the piano, each music had it's own story that slams first place for me.",

In the beginning I had to get used to the fights.. parry and dodge is tough, because I play without camera movement (the fights are so much better with camera movement, but I get nauseous from it unfortunately), but once I got used to it, I really started liking the game.

        "review": "TLDR; It was a great game, but it didn't blow me away or anything. I certainly didn't feel the intense hype a lot of others felt for it.\n\nFor context, I played this game and all of its side content to 100% completion.\n\nThe story is unique, and the world is phenomenal. I loved the emotional high points that helped contrast the emotional lows. The characters were excellent for the most part, but I did feel there should have been more time dedicated to interpersonal relationships and backstories. Most things you learn is through symbolic visuals, text, or interactions/dialogue where characters are standing in one spot just talking at each other and not doing anything. If characters did actually end up doing something other than stand there, it was often off-screen with a text description. Don't get me wrong. I absolutely adore cerebral media that doesn't spell things out for you in black and white - but maybe add a bit more overworld banter or something to endear you to these people even more to make it feel a bit more natural.\n\nWith all that being said, the characters and story are the only reason I kept playing this game.\n\nI understand this is a small indie team and there is only so much they can do with limited funds and resources on such an ambitious project, but a lot of character models were too similar to each other. There were definitely a lot of non-plot related re-uses of character assets/models even among those closely associated to main characters. This was confirmed by the lead designer who said that they used the same base model for every character. For such a visually striking world, most people within it were very lackluster.\n\nThis is entirely a personal preference - but I do not like this games style of combat since I despise QTEs. Character builds became INSANELY powerful which for me, I loved one-shotting everyone including the hardest side-boss in the game. But I could see people who prefer a challenge being disappointed by how overpowered you are in the late game. I also have a love for fighting MASSIVE bosses and just seeing massive creatures in general. Most games can't seem to get the scaling and perspective correct and instead of an intimidating and fantastical vibe it ends up failing entirely. Clair Obscur does creature scaling SO WELL - it was always so unsettling and satisfying to fight/see the monolith-sized creatures.\n\nThe maps and \"exploration\" gave me anxiety because I always worry about missing items and there is no mini map. It was hard to remember what places and areas I had been to or 100% completed which led me to waste a LOT of time going back and forth. I really wish there were better indications of where things are in the overworld map or at the very least a completion percentage for areas. \n\nThere is also no real incentive to starting a New Game+ as you can essentially level up to 99, complete all side-quests and choose both endings without starting over. There are no new outfits, music records, journals, or story content. New Game+ is purely for harder combat and new loot, with only one new joke weapon that if you didn't know about how to obtain before starting the game the first time, will take multiple full game playthroughs which to me, sounds nightmarish.\n\nWhile most of my review is merely subjective criticism I will say there is one MAJOR objective issue I had with the game and that is performance. I bought and played the game months after release and there was surprisingly NO effort or patches to address the egregious NVIDIA GPU compatibility issues. Every single cutscene froze and stuttered effectively ruining its most powerful cinematic moments. Even some fancy end game cinematic boss moves that I'm sure would have been totally amazing to see would freeze or stutter which really killed the excitement and magic of it all. I find it unacceptable that a lot of PC players are forced to install 3rd party mods if they want the game function correctly.",

Nitpicking, there are a couple of tiny bugs here and there but nothing that can't be overlooked in the light of an incredible story, amazing art design and music (gods the music), and top notch game play that flows wonderfully and needs no grinding. There's almost nothing \"missable\" in the game, that is, nothing the game will lock you out of getting later down the line so the anxiety I always feel trying to look things up so I don't miss them is gone and you can just enjoy the game.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely in my top 5 of all time and it's one of those games you'll wish you could forget so you can play it again fresh. Buy it at full price, and then donate some more money to the devs, this is one of those special masterpieces, and they deserve it.",

It reminds me of what Lost Odyssey did, but expanded. Really good fights in this game.\r\n\r\nThis is my Game of the Year. Silksong is a close second.",

There is also a dodge and counter mechanic which does take some getting used to. BUT, if you do die in combat 2 things happen: The game asks if you want to send in the reserve party IE the ones you aren't using in the main party and if you say no it asks if you want to try the battle again. \r\nNo penalty or anything, it just sets up the beginning of the battle again as it was on your first attempt.  It's a great feature that gives you the opportunity to learn when to dodge or parry / counter to get the timing right with no run-back like in Souls-like games.\r\nIf you were somehow on the fence about this game definitely pick it up. You won't regret it.",

The combat is turn based and reactive, players will need to dodge and parry at the correct times to avoid damage. Whilst it was my first time experiencing this type of combat, i can say that it was super fun especially with tougher bosses that would one shot you if you mess up.\n\nIts very rare that a game has the full package - superb storytelling, amazing characters, phenomenal sound design and music, super fun and satisfying combat system and breathtaking visuals. Usually even great games will lack in one of these areas but this game does not which is why i genuinely believe this is one of those games that everyone should try and see for themselves.\n\n9.5/10 - a near perfect game",

However, a day or so after finishing the game I've been thinking more about it and I've come to the conclusion that I really didn't enjoy it.\n\nThe dodge-parry-jump-gradient parry system ruins the balance of the game. I say that as someone who could consistently parry enemy attacks on the second or third time seeing that, specific, attack. Either I A) parry everything and take no damage whilst also dealing massive parry damage to my opponent or B) get hit and die after like three combos.\n\nNeither option is great, to be honest. In the first case, you end up breezing through everything. The parry system making the game a breeze and, more importantly, largely invalidating build crafting. Because why bother with a 5 step combo with Lune to build stains into Mayhem or Elemental Genesis when I could just parry boss attacks and suffer no problems.\n\nAnd in the second case, I have to kill everything before they attack because otherwise I'll die. \n\nI genuinely, therefore, cannot reccomend this game because it just isn't enjoyable.",

I was expecting the parry and quick time aspect but did not realise that it is the only  mechanic that matters. There is no depth to the combat at all, which is what makes turn based combat fun, instead you mindlessly repeat the same combos every combat and try to learn the parry window, which is where you do most of your damage. Quite disappointed to be honest, was really looking forward to this one.",

But unfortunately despite all of it's excellent moments, it has glaring flaws that can be vastly detrimental to enjoying the game. \r\n\r\nBut, I'll start with the good. This game is truly dazzling, from story to graphics, character development, mind-bending enemy design, a truly unique experience.. and even the gameplay despite the major flaws which I'll get into, is very fun when you're on it's good side. I can almost recommend this game just on this stuff alone, cause this is a masterclass in building a world that feels real to the player, AAA devs should take notes.\r\n\r\nThe flaws, man, I played this game on the medium/normal difficulty, originally intended the hardest difficulty as I normally do (as I have with even games such as doom eternal), but honestly, I don't think the difficulty you play at actually matters. Because here's the thing, whether or not you win fights is completely on whether or not you dodge abilities on time, normally this would be great design, however... There's literally no form of indication for said abilities or a general idea of when to dodge, and that wouldn't matter if it wasn't so goddamn punishing when you mistime it despite meeting a new enemy with new attacks and intentionally delayed or off-time attacks to trip you up. But man, if you don't dodge? You're going to wipe, a lot. Like, most of the game I spent save scumming and restarting 90% of fights just to learn the new attacks. I would agree and say 'skill issue' but I don't think this is good game design, It should feel natural when to dodge when seeing an attack, and if it isn't, you need a visual cue.  \r\n\r\nSo despite how much I love everything else, I can't recommend this to most people, it's far too aggravating to actually enjoy the game. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

There isn't anything like this right now theme-wise, but with the popularity that is sure to change. We all benefit from this game's existence, and you can feel the love behind it in the presentation, story, and direction.

Interesting story, creative world and monster designs, and excellent music that come together to make something that stands alone. \r\n\r\nThe game systems take a little getting used to as each playable character has different core mechanics, but this makes for a lot of flexibility in composing your party and it's fun to have more to learn fairly far into the game. When combined with a lot of influence on your build from things you can equip and abundant respec resources, you have a lot of freedom to play around with builds and find crazy, layered combos.\r\n\r\nThe ability to concoct elaborate combos does affect the middle to late game, where you can go quite quickly from doing ok to being overpowered if you explore too much before advancing the story. In the late game I'd recommend just forging ahead with the story to keep the fights with high story stakes challenging, after which you're able to do post-credits exploration, which unlocks some much greater additional challenges.",

Combining our favorite parts of souls-like gameplay with classic JRPG combat and open world exploration, this game has a little something for everyone as you explore the dying world.\nBeyond the notable combat systems that grow increasingly more difficult as you progress through the game. Clair Obscur's world, and story are easily some of the best I have seen in recent years, encouraging the player to grow attached to the characters and become emotionally invested in their story as they traverse the world in an attempt to reach the Paintress whom sits upon her monolithic throne. The original sound track, and sound design for the game only adds emotion to the game and allows the player to completely immerse themselves within the world.\n\nEasily better than most modern AAA games with a significantly smaller team and budget. This game will easily sit among some of my all time favorites alongside BG3, Silksong, Horizon, and more. 11/10 this game is an absolute masterpiece.\n- For those who come after.",

But what really sets COE33 apart is the story and characters. Very, very, very few games are able to deliver truly deep narratives, with complex themes and multi-dimensional characters backing it all up. Expedition 33 nails all of it. If you're on the fence in the slightest, play this game. It's worth it.",

The combat might not be for everyone, but I think its worth it for anyone to try and crank the difficulty down if they are having trouble. You can tell that the developers put their heart and soul into this work of art (pun intended)! Easily one of the  best games of the last decade! Highly recommend to anyone who wants a beautiful story driven experience that they will remember long after they finish the game. This is the only game I have 100% in my entire life and gotten all the achievements! It will make you say WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE and you only will WHOOOOO when you finish the game. Absolute cinema!",

        "review": "Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 – A Masterpiece in Motion (10/10)\r\n\r\nExpedition 33 is a breathtaking combination of art and RPG that redefines turn-based combat. Its unique system blends tactical depth with real-time dodging, parrying, and timed counters, making every encounter feel fresh and exhilarating.\r\n\r\nThe story is a poetic descent into a surreal world, rich with emotional weight and philosophical undertones. Each character feels deeply human, their arcs woven into a narrative that’s as haunting as it is hopeful.\r\n\r\nVisually, it’s staggering and absolutely beautiful, the environments pulse with atmosphere, and the character/enemy designs are both elegant and eerie. Complementing this are multiple soundtracks that are absolute bangers and they linger long after you’ve put down the controller, just utterly mesmerizing.\r\n\r\nExpedition 33 doesn’t just tell a story—it immerses you in one. It’s a bold, emotional and beautiful triumph that earns a well-deserved 10/10, and it is definitely my personal GOTY.\r\n",

        "review": "If you have even the slightest hesitation, read this, but I’ll warn you now, there are spoilers, so maybe don’t read it at all xd\n\nI keep asking myself if I’m even worthy enough to praise this game, because if this doesn’t win Game of the Year, I honestly don’t know what should. I don’t even know where to start because the art, the music, the environment design, everything is just breathtaking. It’s made by such a small team, yet you can feel how much heart and purpose went into every part of it. You can tell they wanted to create something meaningful. It’s worth every single penny.\n\nThe music is absolutely outstanding. I tried to find something to criticize but it’s honestly hard. Maybe the only small thing I’d say is that Maelle’s voice actress doesn’t perfectly fit a 16 yearold girl, it felt just slightly off to me. But that’s barely even a complaint, more like nitpicking. It doesn’t hurt the game in any way.\n\nOverall, the game is incredible. Having two different endings and being able to experience the story from everyone’s perspective is such a thoughtful touch. Every single character has their own story and they’re all beautifully written. You keep wondering about their pasts, their reasons, their emotions. It constantly makes you want to learn more. I haven’t been this curious about a game in years, and that curiosity makes you want to keep playing nonstop.\n\nThe character designs are amazing, even the smallest enemies are designed with so much care and detail. Movement through the world feels smooth, the dialogues are entertaining, and the characters genuinely feel alive. There’s real depth here.\n\nThe third arc was incredibly fun. I saw people saying they stopped after the first chapter but don’t do that. Losing Gustave broke me, but that scene was absolutely brilliant, both emotional and cinematic.\n\nBeing able to find hairstyles and outfits in the game and actually equip them was such a great design choice. It makes you feel even more connected to the characters. Everything about Esquie is just pure joy. The idea of discovering parts of the map that normally stay locked using her is genius. Whoever thought of that deserves praise. Even her falling-on-the-belly moment made me laugh so hard, I still think about it. I even bought her little plush already.\n\nThere’s almost nothing I didn’t like about this game, and it’s the first time I’ve played something like this. Expedition 33 isn’t just a game, it’s an experience worth living. And seriously, congratulations. I’ve never played a game like this before, one that truly made me want to keep playing. This is what real game development looks like.\n\nEspecially saying this:\n“I am ‘Whee’ but I am also ‘Whoo’. So the ‘Whee’ balances the ‘Whoo’.”\n\nRating: 10/10 🎮✨",

Yes the gameplay itself is very specificlally a round based RPG, but what it tries to do, it does so with incredible precision and skill. Is this a game for everyone? Probably not. Sadly not.As i believe the story this game provides is one for the ages.\n\nGet it if you value a good story. Get it if you value a good turn based RPG. Heck get it even if you just value great music and voice acting. Its cheap. This is no 80€ AAA game. Its far more than that. This game, along with Baldurs Gate 3 and a few other titles are what gaming should be.\n\nMaybe not a 10/10 perfect game, but definitely a 9/10 game for all the people who really love gaming.\n\nThank you Sandfall for providing this experience,",

        "review": "If possible I would put this as a Maybe. But as I have to pick between Yes and No, ultimately I choose No.\n\nExpedition 33 is a game about closure, that ironically does not know what it wants. The game pretends it is a turn based RPG, however there are so many quick time events that being able to parry is a much more important skill than understanding the mechanisms behind team comp. Parrying is so good that if you're not doing it, the game will feel like a punishing slog. If you are doing it, you don't need the turn based aspect because you can kill nearly every encounter easily.\n\nThe story wants to wrench at your heart strings and make you think. However, after dramatic moments when people are actively sobbing, you will also encounter the Gestral Beach nearby where you can do jumping puzzles to put your depressed, sad women in bikinis. The game wants to present a terrifying and mysterious world, ala Bloodborne, but at the same time keeps enough light hearted optional side areas around that the tone frequently whiplashes.\n\nThe story builds up to a climatic choice (spoilers ahead): Will you return to being a crippled and disfigured girl for life or remain in a world of wonder with loving friends and family? Facing reality vs. escapism. All that build up about the complexity of life is reduced to a trite binary choice. Not even mentioning that one essentially kills the entire magical world so you can go sort out your upper class parents fighting over who can be maladapted better.\n\nAnd you, of course, regardless of your choices can do New Game+. Because in a game about choices and closure, there's nothing like replaying it and remaking your choices. This is something fancy game reviewers sometimes call ludonarrative dissonance.\n\nLastly I need to critique the game itself. I needed 2 mods to actually get the game to run without crashing. One for the combat to stop crashing (thanks Directx12) and one for the cutscenes to not crash (because if you switch to Dx11 to fix the former...yeah no). I make it a rule not to recommend games that don't work out of the box, and this game did not.\n\nThe game has lovely worldbuilding, a fascinating environment, a great hook to start you out, and solid visual design. Unfortunately it can't choose what it actually wants to be, between its combat, its story, and its fundamental game design. Ultimately I much more enjoyed Act 2 than anywhere else because Act 3 felt trite, and Act 1 drip feeds you the tools you need to actually enjoy things. So I lean on the side of No, because there are much better RPGs out there, much better turn based strategy, and much more coherent stories that don't muddle their metaphors.",

And the late-game content after defeating the final boss is a great addition to the story for those who want to experience everything. Doing 100% was also a lot of fun.\n\n33/10, highly recommended.",

Everytime I write a review, I try to be as objective as possible, in order to not let my personal tastes taint the objective quality of the product.[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nVery high graphics quality. A noteworthy job has been done, especially about the details regarding lights, shadows, colours, particle and environmental effects. A praiseworthy attention to detail has been put in every location, leaving no stone unturned. The facial expressions in the cutscenes are of great quality as well. It is possible to witness a strong artistic inspiration in many places of the game.\n\n[b]Score: 9.7 / 10[/b]\n\n\n[h1]Narrative[/h1]\n\nThe narrative rhythm is well matched with the gameplay, creating a good balance between the player's interaction and the progression of the story. The subject matters of the story have been tackled in an intelligent, sensible and skilful way. The dialogues are of great quality, and the characters are well portrayed.\n\n[b]Score: 9.6 / 10[/b]\n\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe difficulty level is impeccably coherent with its description. The software optimization is very good (on a machine that surpasses the recommended requirements, it is possible to play at 60 fps with half settings on \"high\" and half on \"maximum\"). The fighting system is creative, functioning, varied and designed to be friendly with any kind of player.\n\n[b]Score: 8.7 / 10[/b]\n\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\n\nFautless voice acting. The sound effects are very clear, clean and detailed, favouring a great immersion in the game.\n\n[b]Score: 9.3 / 10[/b]\n\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\n\nThe product has many, high / sublime quality soundtracks, each one coherent with the circumstance during which it's played.\n\n[b]Score: 10 / 10 [/b]\n\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n\nOn the overall, it's a game I'd recommend to try to any player, regardless of personal tastes. It's a product of great quality, with excellences in more than one field. \n\n[b]Score: 4.7 / 5 [/b]\n",

Expedition 33 has such well written and mature characters and a script that assumes you are an intelligent adult and doesn't spoon feed you. \n\nSuperb turn-based combat, the game is fast & snappy, getting in and out of battles is a dream, and the UI is always responsive, the battles are very satisfying. Highly recommend playing this at 60 FPS if you can. Ultimately this is a fantastic turn-based JRPG at the core, with an incredible French spin and lots of modern and well implemented gameplay mechanics.\n\nThe voice acting was wonderful throughout and I think Andy Serkis was superb as Renior. The soundtrack to this game is phenomenal, they knocked it out of the park. So many beautiful moving tracks, but also upbeat epic and fun tracks as well. Many of them are stuck in my head days after playing the game. It reminds me of the original Final Fantasy VII soundtrack. I highly recommend watching Skill Up's \"The making of Clair Obscur\" on YouTube to learn more about the small team behind this game and better understand their achievement.",

Clair Obscur is the kind of game that lingers after the credits roll, not because of how much it offers, but because of how much it gets right. It’s rare to see a game so mechanically confident and emotionally grounded, but that's exactly what Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is.",

The fact that it's the developer's first game is just ridiculous. The characters, story, gameplay/combat system/build variety, creativity, and especially the soundtrack are all top tier.\n\nI've never been so sad about finishing a game, and I don't think I'll ever enjoy an RPG or JRPG as much as this one. As someone who doesn't buy many games outside of the summer/winter sales, this game is absolutely worth the $50 full price. Getting it on sale is great, but if you can afford to pay full price, I think waiting months or even years to see this game get a 25%+ discount just isn't worth it. The game is too good. It's way better than a lot of the $70 new big-name games we get nowadays that are never worth that much money.",

I did that to blow off steam over the Simon boss fight. MAYBE I will give him a fair shake for NG+ but let's get on with the review first.\n\nI'm starting with the core mechanics. You might think that doing a JRPG with QTEs is a stupid idea because QTEs are a stupid idea. But somehow  the French have innovated a hybrid actionesque QTE and JRPG game that in almost every sense combines the best of both. Gone are the days of needing to do resource management through the early stages. Gone are trying to optimize weapon and armor buildouts. Instead the devs relied on a simpler weapon/attribute/picto balancing that allows for creativity put squarely in the player's hands.\n\nThis is combined with the innovative parry/dodge/super parry/jump system that, crucially, makes it so that grinding is never necessary. There is never any boss or monster that requires you to grind, if you learn the enemy's attacks and stuff. Now granted some monsters are more annoying than others and a few of them (Simon, the Scavenger, the hammer guy) I am convinced have drifting parry windows that are cheap in a way that detracts from the fun. But those encounters are still beatable and even cheeseable so you're never stuck. Except maybe for the hands guys until you get the ability to blow past 9999 damage.\n\nThe story is also fantastic. The twist after act 2 legit caught me off guard and is the kind of twist that in lesser hands could have ended in disaster. But the ending was legit touching and thoughtful and I hadn't been this engaged in an RPG's story since, you guessed it, Persona 5, but I think this actually beats out P4/P5. Most of the characters, playable or otherwise, are fleshed out enough, and I think like 95% of the lore made sense. Importantly they left the door open for future adventures AND with me wanting more.\n\nThere are weaknesses in the game, but as one commenter helpfully pointed out as if I didn't know, the truly shitty encounters are mostly optional. (Except the Scavenger boss, who can rot in capital-H Hell.) There are occasionally monsters who as I said earlier are more difficult to parry because of inconsistent parry timing which I think is unfortunate since the parry mechanic is basically the heart and soul of the game's combat and some enemies just sorta punish you for trying to use it. Why? Why do that devs.\n\nThis brings me to Simon. Yes, I know guys, Simon can probably be cheesed to hell. Yes, in theory if you are a god gamer and just parry him you can't lose, and I am 100% sure there are giga gamers who can beat him blindfolded with a DDR pad and can one-shot him with some fucked up build. I am willing to bet though that the average E33 player isn't really going to be able to figure out how to beat him because he's specifically designed to a) undermine almost every way for you to defend yourself and b) be as irritating as possible because you have to mulch through at least 6-7 minutes of his first phase before you hit his fucked up second phase where even on easy he can team-wipe you with one of his obnoxious rapid-fire 500-hit attacks. And I was already at like level 85 when I fought him so being underleveled was not an issue. That entire boss fight had to go back to the drawing board and thank god it's not necessary. But still. I'm not facing him again until I can legit blow him out of the water before he gets a turn in, I do not respect that boss fight.\n\nAside from that, I think there are only minor complaints left:\n\n1) Exploration does not feel that rewarding because you're either searching for lumina or pictos or the occasional weapon. There simply doesn't feel like enough types of items lying around to make exploration that interesting even if it benefits you. Perhaps in a sequel there could be accessories and such for the player to use/wear, or maybe some other kinds of items, so that poking around can give a wider variety of stuff to pick up. And yes no shit I know Pictos are basically supposed to substitute for armor and stuff but it gets very samesy having few things to actually look around for (that are useful, not counting records and stuff).\n\n2) Gustave and his gf's storyline kinda just goes out the window after act 1. I was surprised he didn't come back at all given that an entire game mechanic was built around him, and I was also surprised the flower lady gf didn't make a comeback because I was sure that nevron that planted flowers and wasn't killed was like her or something. But that was based on an incomplete understanding of what being gommaged meant I guess. I'm not sure what could have been done to flesh out that story mind you but it does feel like the first third of the game was building that aspect up only for it to be chucked like so many cybernetic arms.\n\n3) The final bosses (if we're also counting Maelle and I guess Verso if you go the other route) being piss easy also threw me. I was afraid they'd do something fucked up a la Simon but instead i was clearly overleveled (only at 89 though, but even on hard this would have been a cakewalk) and I guess they were only calibrated for players who mostly skipped the optional areas before moving on to Dark Lumiere. I think it might have been a little fairer if there was some final boss leveling just to keep things interesting, and if I had known how OD I was I would have at least switched back to hard.\n\n4) As beautiful as the game looks, the copy/pasting of character models for Regular Lumiere was disappointing. Also some of the NPC animations of the humans look awkward (a kid pantomimes crying despite his face not moving, which was endearing but also technically not good).\n\nDespite those shortcomings the game really deserves the hype and I will go back for more NG+ when the DLC is released, so if you're reading this in the future, uh, I will have played the DLC but probably not come back to update this review. Anyway, I stand by my Simon criticism and look forward to slaughtering him with a disrespectful cheese build.\n\nOh P.S. If for some reason you haven't played the game yet and read this review and got spoiled on some shit, I do recommend playing the game on French audio despite what appears to be some poor lipsynching to match it. The English voice acting is flawless, but for some reason a game set in France has people who speak in English and even Scottish accents? At least get some Pepe le Pieux English speakers who can do a French accent. If I had known  I could have used French audio from the jump I would have. Or if you're not put off by Angloids saying \"merde\" and \"putain\" go crazy, I can't stop you anyway.\n\nP.P.S. Speaking of which, and this is a general problem for subs in games, but if I play with subtitles on, I expect there to be subtitles whenever a character says something, including in battle. My Franch is not good enough to translate what Lune says before she blows someone up with lightning bolts or whatever. Throw me a bone please",

I just went off and googled the spoilers for the story so, I wouldn't have to play the game to get to it. Because why? Cause the game is BORING and just drags on and the unanswered questions are the only reason I kept playing.\n\nThe UI is clunky as hell and in some cases just makes no sense.  The game starts out SO SLOW and this goes on for several HOURS!  There's way to much front-loading that just leaves you asking more questions then when the front loading started.  The pace is horrible.  They introduce different mechanics with each party member but, don't explain it well enough or give you direct understanding of how to make the combat actions produce the promised results.  And why is this an issue? Because the freaking UI info for those combat actions is also clunky and does not explain itself.  What do these icons mean? Is this a fire icon? Does this ability cost or produce that resource?  How many ability points or resources of fire etc. do I currently have available to spend?  Don't know cause the UI sucks.\n\nBeing able to upgrade/progress your weapons and attack skills is put off until WAY too far into the game.  It's so frustrating. \n By the time I was able to get to the point in the the game that they would let me, the resources I had would only take my weapons up to level 3 and already had level 4 weapons.  So, it didn't matter.  And do you know why else it didn't matter? Because I was sick battling it out by that time and had put the game in story mode that's why. \n\nGlad I googled the story spoilers.  I would have been disappointed even more if I played 30+ hours to get to its end.\n\nI don't get why everyone is ga ga over this game.  It just really is not good and I'm offended that I was convinced otherwise.  If I had a box copy right now, it would be so cathartic to take it into the back yard and burn it in the fire pit.

In some scenes it's used fantastically creating wonder silhouettes on a backdrop. Buuut, for a lot of the game, it just smudges everything and makes it hard to see or enjoy the beauty.\r\n\r\nIt is well known how good this game is at this point from transcendent music to tight gameplay and absolutely wonderful level design. The story and dialogue are so frickin fantastic creating memorable and memeable characters.\r\n\r\nIt's fun, it's emotional, it's delightfully French. \r\n\r\nPlay the prologue, if that doesn't hook you by then, Steam's got your back.\r\n\r\nThere's so much love in each area, little details that foreshadow the future or tell a story of the past. The combat mechanics is the best cross between Sekiro and Last Remnant with the style of Persona. Nuff ramblies, just play it.",

They just crushed it.\r\n\r\nBut I have a confession... I quit in old Lumiere (is that the name?  can't remember).  I didn't even see how it ended.  I knew I was getting close and I read that there is a TON of side content, or I could just continue on being near the end.  And I dunno, I just faded off it.  I keep thinking I'll at least watch the cut scenes for the end but I haven't yet.\r\n\r\nI think it's the combat and builds.  Part of me knows it's great, and I did enjoy it.  But not that much.  JRPG turn based is just not my jam.\r\n\r\nStill, excellent game.  Worth it at full price.",

To rattle the bullet points:\r\n\r\n- A truly legendary, heartfelt, 7hr soundtrack, running the length of classical bliss to electric beats to rock/opera epics\r\n\r\n- Some of the most visually striking environments in the gaming landscape, each one a painting in of itself\r\n\r\n- A really damn good turn-based combat system with parry mechanics, rhythm game style, as well as party and elemental synergies that keep things fresh, always\r\n\r\n- A poignant story about the usual suspects, grief, love, family, etc, but presented in such a damn solid narrative that it pulls you in effortlessly and makes you invested in the cast\r\n\r\nAnd if that wasn't enough, it's being sold as a first project from a small team, with some incredible VA, acting, and graphical talent, packed into a price tag lower than the modern standard. \r\n\r\nThis game, this work of art, is a dream to experience and a splash of cold water to sit and think on. Some of the best talent I've had the pleasure of witnessing in recent memory. I deliberated on writing this review as I feel like many others have put it better, but this world needs to know that I adore Clair Obscur: Expedition 33!!! And possibly the best recommendation I can give is that every single time, it is worth experiencing for yourself.\r\n\r\nSandfall, you've outdone yourselves, and you deserve your flowers. We continue.\r\n\r\n(And if nothing else, I beg, listen to the soundtrack. Lorien Testard is a genius composer, and Alice Duport-Percier's vocals breath the divine into these songs. We even get a duet with her and Ben Starr, who also voices a character in the game. To die for)",

There's a great Steam Guide that provides spoiler-free builds for all characters that is helpful if you want gameplay advice. I recommend most people try Normal mode - yes, the combat is tense and challenging, but it's THRILLING. 'Getting good' is not as bad as it might sound and it is absolutely worth the effort. Nevertheless, I don't say that to gatekeep: there's no shame in playing on a lower difficulty and you'll still have a wonderful time; just give the challenge a chance.\n\nMake sure to buy the soundtrack and also download the bonus soundtrack on their website, but don't listen to any of the songs until you hear them in-game. The soundtrack is divided into \"Acts,\" but be warned that they don't reflect the order you hear them in the story: there are songs in \"Act I\" of the soundtrack that you won't hear in-game until the end of Act 2 or even later. Many of the songs are subdivided based on the names of locations, such as \"Flying Waters\" - you can usually listen to those groups of songs once you've cleared the region with the same name.",

The game looks absolutely beautiful. There is really good enemy variety. The game can be easy or incredibly difficult depending on your settings. Character progression and build experimentation is probably one of the most fun parts of the game. Replaying on New Game+ was even more fun than playing it for the first time, especially since you can actually understand all the little references in the first half of the game. \nThat all being said, I have to talk about the ending(s). I chose the \"good\" ending the first time around, and I didn't really have a problem with it. Then I played the game a couple more times. You spend so much time developing the characters and forming relationships throughout the entire game, but no matter which ending you choose, it feels wasted and hollow. Like it never mattered. None of your choices or progressions impact the result of the chosen final ending.\nLiterally everything up until the ending of this game is fantastic. But then they fumbled at the finish line. But it's about the journey, not the destination. Had the ending been better, I would have given this a 10/10, however due to it, I'll give it a final score of:\n9/10\n100% worth playing.",

        "review": "There aren't any spoilers below.\r\n\r\nGreat RPG that combines elements of Paper Mario and a ton of Sekiro. Focuses a great deal on presentation and narrative rather than strictly lore and world-building with a cast of characters and dialogue that is easy to enjoy, even if a handful of them don't get enough time in the spotlight to really shine... despite being stuck with them all game.\r\n\r\nThe first half of the game is pretty packed and doesn't really miss a beat. The endgame is a bit of a miss and directionless at times, even with respect to what it was actively trying to do/be. Breaking the seemingly intended sequence can easily result in a lot of encounters just being ruined due to the nature of finding absurd upgrades well before you're meant to have them. I do like that the setups and approaches to optimization in the first half are drastically different to that in the second half though, due to the major restriction in place. After you unlock the last mechanics by the end though, one of them doesn't really go used outside of 5 or so specific encounters, and this is of course, assuming you aren't already at the point of 1-shotting everything.\r\n\r\nIn the advent of Metaphor and this game's release, it's nice to see more streamlined approaches to the RPG format for those that don't have a lot of time to sink into grand scale 80+ hr long stories. I do hope though that the standard this game sets doesn't actively shake up things too much in the scene. As one who didn't really ever drop turn-based games when the Final Fantasy series jumped ship and switched primarily to action (in addition to many other classic RPG titles), I think there's still a place for those really long adventure titles that can't really be replaced by games like this.\r\n\r\nRegardless, this game gets high marks from me and is an easy recommend, even for people who don't actively like the turn-based genre. It's streamlined, has funny builds, funny characters, a handful of serious topics, and treats the player like they're an adult.",

Clair Obscur is a masterpiece of visuals, like Dark Souls, Witcher, Horizon, Assassin's Creed, God of War Universes and so on, but the story, the characters... it's something else. I wish it was more joyfull, to many deaths, to sad of an ending... I wanted a happy ending, where loved ones come back together, have fun and laugh over all the bad things that happened. But no. Nevertheless, the story is just great, so many unexpected plots, such a big world, so many enemies... Fighting is great, lots of different combos and different patterns that we have to break... I just hope that guys from sundfall will think of a happy ending in the future to add to the game, to give us a happy reason to cry on, not a lot of sad ones.",

I'm sure that anyone going into this adventure with an open mind would enjoy the combat.\n\nThe story is amazing, I've been gaming for more than 20 years, and i gotta say that this story captivated me from the beginning till the end, and the game easily fits into my top 10 games EVER played, maybe even in my top 5.\n\nThe devs poured their hearths into this game and it shows, what a great experience this was and i would recommend it to everybody.",

Which is understandable since it is made by a relatively small studio. So I will definitely be waiting for the next games from these devs as I feel that with the resources they now have - they might create some of the best games ever made.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that might not be for everyone is the combat. I had a love-hate relationship with it throughout the playthrough but I did end up ultimately enjoying it, though it did take installing a couple of quality of life mods.\r\nAlso note that you can easily over-level by doing the secondary missions, like oneshot the end boss type of over-level. So if you want to experience proper story bosses - I would suggest leaving the secondary locations for the NG+.\r\n\r\nOtherwise the game has a beautiful soundtrack, a unique visual style, and an interesting story. Though the story is somewhat short - hence the lack of scope I mentioned before, as some story beats just don't have enough buildup. I feel like out of a ~50 hours playthrough (it can probably be done in around 20 if you ignore the non-quest locations) the game only had like a couple hours of actual story content with the rest being combat/exploration. And with how well the story/dialog is done here I really wanted more than I got.\r\n\r\nOverall I definitely recommend this game and I will surely be replaying it in the future, especially since there is more additional content on the way.",

Encountered a few technical issues during my play through such as artifacting, a weird red miasma over darker scenes, and infrequent crashing but I'm unsure how much of that is Nvidia driver issues versus issues with Sandfall Interactive's programming. My only real complaint is with a particular optional boss just being way to steep of a difficulty increase in a game that is already difficult. \n\nI look forward to more adventures in this universe if we get them.\n\n(The red miasma effect can be fixed by going into nvidia control panel, going to managed 3D settings, Program settings selecting Expedition 33, and changing Anisotropic filtering to \"Application Controlled\")\n(The artifacting and infrequent crashing was fixed by just reinstalling nvidia drivers after my PC went to sleep)",

        "review": "The premise of the game is as dramatic as the stunning visuals and zooming, panning camera, which gets more action than my fingers do on the controller. Let's start with the premise. The world is ending because people are dying yearly based on their age. All the 34 years old characters dramatically pass away in flurry of flowers at the start of the game, leaving the those 33 years and younger to form Expedition 33 in search and destroy mission to find the mysterious Paintress. And right from the start the juxtaposition of this brutal reality with a cute French theme, operatic music, baguettes and effeminate males, is discordant. I'm not sure if this is trait expected from JRPGs and but whatever it is I'm not convinced that I like it. It lacks grit. It lacks the understated. It's as if the director wanted you to wallow in the emotions of the characters so you can feel every nuance of the game.  Environments where corpses litter the field in the thousands are not needed to convince me of horror. A handful will do.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the camera work is equally dramatic. I feel it does more actions per minute than you do while playing the game. It's always zooming in, zooming out, panning, shooting up and down, however many degrees of freedom it has, all are used within a few seconds. Just chill a bit.\r\n\r\nWith the stuff I did not like out of the way, lets get to the good bits. The gameplay and combat is fun. There's a lot of depth in the semi turn based combat. I say semi because when your characters are attacked there are windows where you can get them to parry or dodge. These are important mechanics to master since without at least dodging your party will wipe. If you've played Sekiro you'll find the parrying familiar. The game makes parrying a skill based action because it provides audio and visual cues in that tell you when to hit that parry button. Additionally there's none of that artificial difficulty that creeps into souls-like games where you fall of an edge and die. The game doesn't punish you for errors that are not related to the gameplay. This is one of the flaws of souls-like games that Expedition 33 avoids, and it avoids making the player feel like they are grinding.\r\n\r\nTLDR:\r\nIf you can pack an emotional tampon to handle the sentimentality that oozes through this game, and enjoyed the parrying mechanic from Sekiro, and like the puzzle aspect of turn based combat then this game will scratch those itches.

I'm here to say, I'm 33 hours in, discovering the game myself, and it's not only as good as they say, but better. An actual masterpiece.\r\n\r\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a game everyone should experience. It's not only a love letter for old-school turn-based RPG fans like myself, but to gaming in general.

You can see Dark Souls, Slay the Spire, Persona, Devil May Cry, Final Fantasy, among others in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's DNA, and it's beautiful to see how it creates something new and striking.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for not just a memorable RPG, but a defining experience, look no further, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has strong characters in a amazing story, art direction that will blow you away, and music that will take your breath and make many of the game's most impacting moments even more captivating.",

But to sum up the game without spoiling anything it is a fresh take on turn based combat, it has some of the best music I've seen in a game, it has one of the most interesting stories in recent memory, all of the characters were memorable and well written, and it looks great and runs pretty well.

The game world is ripe with breath-taking views, stunning and engaging combat, and opens up to lots of adventure and exploration. I cannot think of a single character that I did not like in this game. There are so many memorable moments throughout the story that will make you laugh, cry, and experience genuine happiness. This game far surpassed my expectations for an indie studio. Not many games have made it into my top 10 favorite game spots, but this one 100% gets a spot in the list for me! Well done Sandfall! you guys knocked this one out of the park.",

        "review": "I completed Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 on the weekend of my 33rd birthday (still here, thank goodness) and I was surprised to find myself comparing the experience to the first time I played Halo: Combat Evolved, Silent Hill 2, Dark Souls, and Kingdom Hearts 1: I was playing a new favorite game.\n\nAs I played through Expedition 33, the thought that kept coming to mind was that the people who made this game—from the art designers to the writers, the composer, and the programmers—had a shared vision and executed it beautifully.\nThis game did not feel as though it was made by various \"departments\", but rather by a relatively small group of people who brought their respective skills to the table to create something beautiful, meaningful, and very fun.\n\nI will not go into a full review; the gameplay does deserve plenty of praise for its depth and great taste in inspirations, but I need to touch on one element that stood out  to me in particular. As someone who does not usually require a stellar story or compelling characters to enjoy games, Expedition 33 needs to be commended for the way its characters are written. No one is a stand-in for a flavor-of-the-month political cause, and no one is the self-insert of a theater kid living out their YA novel fan-fiction power fantasies (an issue I had with BG3). Every character in this game lives an incredibly tragic existence, and they behave appropriately in light of that, while also briefly allowing for levity at the right moments. The characters are not meant to represent you or me; they are meant to serve an amazing story, and one cannot help but grow attached to them for it.\n\nI cannot recommend Expedition 33 enough, even if turn-based RPG's are not what you normally go for. It is an inspired and much-needed masterpiece in our age of soulless, iterative forever-games.\n\n\n\n\n",

The story is brilliant and keep you feeding bit by bits as the story go and keep entertaining through the whole gameplay. I never been the biggest fan of turn based  games with a few exceptions like x-com series  but never imagined I will does a more action packed one. The atmosphere combined with the music is just phenomenal, Its hard to describe when a cutscene perfecly match with  breathtaking music or give weight to a hard fight. And the most important part is the acting. The  actors did a brilliant job bringing life to the characters showing true emotions. I cant wait for this studio to suprise us with another masterpiece. Btw  I never seen another game in the past few years that worth the full price on release like E33.",

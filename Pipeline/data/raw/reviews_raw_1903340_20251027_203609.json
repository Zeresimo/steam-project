It makes it interactive even when it's not your turn adding a level of skill to it. Compared to other turn based games that you have to eat the enemies attacks, in this you can completely counter, and get a attack out of it. I'm not far into the game as of writing this review, but so far the story is really fun, and the combat looks really engaging with how much it gives you to work with.\r\n\r\nDefinitely a one of a kind type of game.",

The turn based combat is exciting as each character has different methods that make them more powerful and can provide synergies with other characters to make them even more powerful. \r\nWould highly recommend this game to any casual gamer that wants to play something beautiful with a stupendous score and turn based combat system.",

        "review": "[For Those Who Come After]\n\nIt's a good game with a mysterious world and a compelling story that keeps you invested. However, I do wish they would of considered putting some quality of life features into the game that tracked sidequests and a minimap to help with exploration. Having a minimap with \"fog of war\" (only seeing what you've explored) would have been immensely helpful in my journey preventing me from running around in circles. Expedition 33 is a straight forward turn-based RPG game that relies heavily on passive abilities you obtain from \"pictos\" which is essentially your gear in any other RPG. You're gonna want to master every pictos you pick up as it allows for your entire party to use the passive abilities from these pictos without equipping them. These passive abilities you obtain is how you are going to optimize your builds along with skills and weapon perks. This results in \"struggle builds\" in the early game where it can be difficult to get an optimize build going because you have to constantly swap out pictos to master. As you progress further into the game, this will become less of a hassle.\n\nI would call it a \"turn-based lite\" as the real-time mechanics requires the skill of dodging, jumping, parrying, and QTEs to survive encounters with not much tactical or strategical depth required to overcome most of its challenges. There is no item management in this game -- you have panacea-like potions that just cures all status effects without worrying about having antidotes, eye drops, phoenix downs, and the likes. Also, there is no positioning in this game -- no moving your party in the front or back to increase parry windows or attacks. Skills cost action points instead of MP, and can regenerate rather quickly with the right passive abilities which encourages more aggressive play. . With that said, this is a more welcoming and accessible turn-based RPG game for players who struggle to overcome the complexities and strategical nuances that most turn-based games have to offer.\n\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a HIGH Recommendation. \n\n\n\n",

What ever those people don't like might actually be superb.\n\nWell after hearing the Soundtrack on my Steam Deck and trying it out there for the first time. \n(That device is a true backlog murder machine.)\nI've decided to try it out on the big screen with more then 40 FPS (It is really not optimized well even on a 9070XT)\nAnd yeah, I came across the usual UE5 things, like blurry shadows, pop-ins, poor performance, reliance on AI fake optimization and so on.\n\nI then did the first tutorial fight an remembered people saying: \"I can never do a normal turn based combat game ever again\". And rolled my eyes, sure, having QTEs spices up the combat, but it is not THAT important. \"I will see what comes next\", I thought to myself. \nBut beating the mime at the harbor on the hardest difficulty only with skill rather then by over-leveling is quite something though, I have to admit. It is not easy to put skill impression into turn based combat, they managed it. \n\"Well, this might not be that bad after-all.\"\n\nAfter wandering around the city for 30 minutes and watching the true intro to this game I came here to make this review.\nGetting a tear out of someone after just that short amount of time is not easy. \nAlthough I have to admit that I am too in my 30s now and imagining that this could be the last thing that I ever do, my last journey after losing my wife, it hit home very strong. \nWhat is there to hope for when facing a god like being that just wiped out thousands of people without even moving?\n\nWell, I'll see!",

I'll only say there is a lot of loss, followed by grief.\r\nThe music needs an award. Go listen to it. \r\nMy only problem are the graphics - Unreal engine sometimes makes things look blurry or causes (out of combat) frame loss.\r\nThe gameplay is good, if you like parrying (there is an easy mode to extend the margin of error) and/ or big numbers after buildcrafting. Exploration is often rewarded and the overworld opens up as you progress. The main path is mostly linear, but you can come back to any side areas sooner or later. If you are struggling with one, you'll be able to return there stronger, no grind needed.\r\n[b] tldr: Great game, I guess France is good now [/b]",

It's pretty often that a new game comes out and the hype can bring my expectations up to an unrealistic standard that can be met. Yet somehow, with the infinite hype, this game met my expectations and shattered them. \r\n\r\nThis game is a love-letter to art. To humanity's ability to always find love in places where you'd never expect. It's not only a masterpiece as a game, but as a work of art.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is phenomenal. It perfectly blends real-time action with the tactics of turn-based combat. The exploration feels rewarding without being overbearing. It's also GORGEOUS, maybe one of the prettiest games of all time. The art is so surreal and otherworldly, while having impeccable attention to detail.\r\n\r\nIt's worth every word of hype it's been given. 10/10",

The gameplay surprisingly keeps you engaged even though it is turn based combat and often I find myself wishing the enemy had more phases, something I never do in other games.

        "review": "Everything you've heard about this game is accurate  - it really is that amazing from beginning to end. That's not to say it has zero flaws, as I definitely think the final portions of the game are a bit oddly paced. There's some improvement that can also be made towards organizing your slots and abilities that you put into them for each character. Also could've used a map within each zone, but that's a me thing as I get lost very easily and some areas were a bit difficult to navigate. Nothing I'm mentioning though takes away from the GOTY it is. I believe it'll be considered classic 20 years from now. I was also one of those people that would catch playthroughs on YT here and there and was skeptical about the hype, to be honest. It's just one of those games that you need to play yourself. And don't let the turn-based element completely turn you off, because it's not the way it's typically handled in other games. You do take your turn to attack/buff/etc, but you still have to be on alert when the enemy or boss decides to try to hit you 5 times in a row and you need to either dodge or parry. I'm terrible at both and would rage, but it usually felt like I could win a battle if I tried hard and readjusted stuff. I liked that I didn't really feel like I had to grind to proceed. Having said that, it's worth looking around because it's a beautiful world, with killer music and some incredible moments with some really amazing characters. For the first time in a long time, I felt really excited to play each time even after dying 5 billion times to the same boss. I didn't look up anything because I just wanted to play it for however long I felt like it. It was refreshing.\n\nFor those who come after, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. It is something special.",

The risks this game and it's daring story takes pay off immensely and really capture the essence of what it is to be human and feel things so very deeply. Its got a great blend of RPG and action mechanics that mesh nearly perfectly, the French cinema influence is so real in the best ways, the characters are incredibly gripping and beautifully crafted and full of so many different layers (for better and for worse), and just. The presentation and the art direction and the pacing and the boss battles and the intertwined mechanics are all so great and just AHHH I could talk for hours tbh.\n\nAnd THE MUSIC. Dear Gods the music is incredible. The sound design in general is perfect (special shout out to the sound that plays when someone achieves a Break) but MANNN Lorien Testard deserves all the accolades in the world for just how incredible the music is, there's such a wide range of tracks that all perfectly fit their moments and encounters and have so much mastery in their construction on offer here. \n\nEven with a few minor issues and technical hiccups and a bit of jank (and a few minigames that will forever bring me rage to think on) it's never enough to truly detract from what was truly a classic in the making. For something so well crafted to be Sandfall's first project, that everyone pulled their weight SO much, it's truly an accomplishment. It's even the first game in a long time I went for 100% completion with bc it was THAT GOOD. PLEASE give this game a shot, you wont regret it\n\nAlso also wish Id played a little bit less at the time I dropped this bc I was SO close to 33.3 hours on review rip",

You don't know your combat numbers, just 'big or small' wtf? One foe hits 130 and SAME ONE (but mostlikely of a higher level, that you cannot see) hits 2k. Randomly upgraded weapons and luminas, and etc.\r\n\r\nThis is just a great fable to walk thru OR master parry and play it.",

Utterly sad (in a devastatingly good way) and just after finishing the game, learning the lyrics and translations of the songs.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt a day one purchase‚Ä¶ it was day two. And I only played it a few weeks later, and‚Ä¶ nothing could have prepared me for this rollercoaster. What should I tell that other fellow expeditioners haven‚Äôt already written in their journals? The parry system is so rewarding, the story still haunts me, it goes very near to me. I have a kid as well, and in the game there were just topics that hit the right spot.\n\nThe characters are chef‚Äôs kiss as well. They are uniquely and beautifully designed, and their facial expressions and dialogues are peak. Finally, characters who don‚Äôt say nonsense or act forced just so the story could continue. The music will forever be in my heart. It is so emotional, I just can‚Äôt stop listening to it.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is just wheeeee, and when you finish it, it is the woo that will haunt you‚Ä¶ maybe forever, until there might be another game which could touch you like that.\nNow I get my whee from singing the songs and watching other people‚Äôs attempts at Simon.\n\nFor those who came after",

It‚Äôs up there with my all-time favorites like Xenoblade Chronicles, Nier Automata, and Final Fantasy X. Expedition 33 has one of the best soundtracks I‚Äôve heard in years‚Äîit really sets the tone and elevates the experience.\r\n\r\nCombat:\r\nThe combat is a fantastic mix of turn-based mechanics with quick-time events, active parrying, and dodging. As a fan of turn-based combat, I see this as an evolution of the genre. It feels dynamic and engaging. I wasn‚Äôt the biggest fan of the quick-time events for certain abilities, but luckily, you can turn them off if you prefer. No complaints there.\r\n\r\nCharacters:\r\nThe cast is absolutely funtastic! Each character is well-developed, and their interactions feel natural and meaningful. The conversations are mature and thought-provoking, making you genuinely care about their journey.\r\n\r\nStory:\r\nWhile I didn‚Äôt love the story, I still really enjoyed it. Act 1 had me completely hooked‚Äîit was compelling and mysterious. However, after that, things became a bit convoluted, and my interest waned slightly. That said, the character moments throughout kept me engaged, and there are still some great twists and turns. For me, Act 1 was fantastic, but the narrative lost a bit of steam after that.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\r\nDespite some minor narrative hiccups, Expedition 33 is easily one of the best games I‚Äôve played in years. It‚Äôs definitely my game of the year so far, and I can‚Äôt recommend it enough.\r\n\r\nRating: 9.5/10",

        "review": "[h2]Confidence counts for a lot... but not everything[/h2]\nThis is one of those titles that I appreciate more than I actually enjoy.\n\nExpedition 33 starts off as strong as any RPG I can think of. The opening hours introduce a world and characters that are instantly captivating, and you'll be totally on board and invested in the story by the time you see the title drop. It's bold and confident in a way that's great to see from an indie studio.\n\nCombat is where we run into the first hitch. I played through the entire game on Expert, because I'm a diehard fan of games like Sekiro and Nine Sols, parry-based defense systems with fast enemy attack patterns. Unfortunately, COE33 mostly reinforces my love of those games by demonstrating what it's like when the gameplay *isn't* tuned to perfection.\n\nParry windows are insanely tight, but worse, they're inconsistent. Some attacks hit on a sound cue, others when the animation collides with your model, others [i]before[/i] the animation collides, and some even [i]after[/i] it, to the point where the parries sometimes have very little to do with the visual attack. Even worse, the camera often puts other party members in the way, or zooms out to a ridiculous degree that makes accurate timing nearly impossible. Enemies love to drag out and delay their swings like they're Margit in molasses, but because it's turn-based you can't do anything to punish them for it. Every attack is unique, sometimes even from the same enemy, which makes combat a neverending process of trial and error.\n\nIn better parry systems, you can improve your core skill at the mechanic enough to take on new enemies and do well--but here, the first time you run into anything new, you're almost guaranteed to have a few party wipes until you memorize their attack patterns and no-hit them. The coup de gr√¢ce is the damage balancing. Up until the last 15 hours or so, I never had access to gear (\"Pictos\") with good enough defensive stats to prevent even trash mobs from one-shotting most of my party members. This means that a single mistake costs you a turn and a revive--par for the course in JRPGs, but absolutely brutal when skipping a turn means having to sit through another attack string from the enemies, some of which can have nearly a dozen hits in them.\n\nDon't play this on Expert.\n\nAll that misery was mostly self-inflicted; but a bigger issue is the story. It's nearly impossible to discuss without spoilers, but the plot plays its cards pretty early regarding some of its foundational mysteries... and I couldn't believe they were actually doing it. It felt like watching someone load up a bunch of foreshadowing shotgun shells, pump the gun, point it squarely down, and blow their own foot off.\n\nAfter that, the narrative stakes are gone and remain utterly impossible to recover. The final act of the game tries to rebuild tension, but it just feels completely deflated. I was shaking my head and going \"who cares?\" during most of the late cutscenes. The actual ending was fine, and thematically appropriate, but left me completely apathetic.\n\nArt and sound are also worth discussing: the visual design is definitely a matter of taste, but personally I didn't care for the look of the world at all after leaving the initial city. It's going for a \"painterly\" aesthetic, but to me most areas and enemies felt like messy blobs of melting goo. The clashing biomes and stark colors are clearly intentional choices, I just don't think they worked.\n\nThe soundtrack, however, constantly astounds with a variety of excellent instrumental, electronic, and choral tracks that blend together in a somehow cohesive whole. Genuinely the highlight of the game. The vocal performances (I played in English) and cutscene motion capture were also excellent across the board.\n\nNow, given the wildly negative review, do I think you should play this? I've gone back and forth on whether this is a recommend or not. Frankly, despite its many, many flaws, it's the kind of game I want to see more of. Ambitious, mature, innovative, and made with clear passion, I'm glad it's seen so much critical success and gotten so much buzz. I just didn't have a very good time [i]playing[/i] the actual thing. But if nothing in this review is a total dealbreaker for you, then I do think it's worth seeing for yourself whether or not you like it.",

        "review": "Is Clair Obscur a perfect game? No. There are a couple of things which stood out to me as negative. The lip syncing and animations can be a little jank. The story has some big plot twists that, in my opinion, didn't execute as well as the developers probably thought it would. \n\n[spoiler] changing the main character halfway through the story did not help, forcing us to play Verso, a character we barely knew right after Gustave was a poor move. Yes, Verso's story is both tragic and integral to the plot but forcing us to play him felt a bit off [/spoiler]\n\nThe reason you should play CO33 is because it's going to be unlike anything you've ever played in the best way possible. It has its influences, sure. But the composition of the entire game is so original and artistically authentic that it stands out in a league of its own. Even if you're not thrilled by the concept of a turn-based JRPG, you'll learn to love it if you approach it with an open mind. \n\nI can say after completion that almost nothing I have ever played comes close to this. It is a true artistic masterpiece, crafted with lots of attention to detail and a concern for the player's enjoyment. Yes, these developers set out to make sure you enjoyed this game. It's not packed with bloated features or irrelevant side quests to get you to keep playing.  And for that reason, they deserve all the praise - and money - in the world.",

The game forces upscaling, even when entirely not necessary (I was trying to run it at 800p with a 2070 super). I'm very sensitive to that ugly upscaled blurriness/ghosting and it's so bad all over the character models, especially on faces. I tried all the mods and settings tweaks to get it to work, but no luck. Other UE5 games made by smaller teams have the option to turn it off, and they look great on my hardware. It is a shame, because I'd love to play the game when they fix it.",

        "review": "[h1] What is Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 [/h1]\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a culmination of both passion and dedication carefully mixed together with a sprinkle of luck, the kind of luck of catching a lightning in a bottle honestly, a pretty well working miracle ensembled in a way that manages to deliver a really solid experience with its pure heart rather than relying on hyper technical industry bending accomplishments funded by multi millionaire studios combined together to bring you the last marvels of technology and seasonal rewards. Hereafter I will discuss about some aspects that the game delivered for me and many others under here as the most beautiful parts of its whole package, such as:\n\n[list]\n[*] Story\n[*] Gameplay\n[*] Soundtrack\n[*] Graphics/Art Direction\n[/list]\n\n[b] - Story - [/b]\nThe looming number in the sky is the same number you see in the title of the game (hells yeah), and, let's say...it's a very central part of the narrative; and that's as far as I am willing to share about it. How profound of you, you might exclaim...but seriously, I'm on a trampoline here...the writing of the story and the main characters inside Expedition 33 story are so well thought out that it needs to be experienced rather than being told for how fresh as a take it is, how striking and impactful it is and how mature it presents itself to the public. The dubbing adds so much more life and colour to what already was an intricate entanglement of plots and characters that it's almost embarrassing for higher end studios to not have this kind of will or care for the craft (let's just tease you by saying that Andy Serkis has a big role in here). The main point here is that E33 doesn't shy away whatsoever from depressing and grounded topics that could easily identify and define any of us playing the game; some relatable experiences that are touched upon in here are just as mundane and heart-breaking as we can experience as human beings in our daily routines, and yet it's also generous in giving you some relief from the cruelties and the inevitabilities of life.\n\n[b] - Gameplay - [/b]\nIt took us 26 years to witness another RPG implement a sort of Quick Time Event skill based system after The Legend of Dragoon (funded, published and abandoned by Sony back in 1999/2001) and It took us another 18 years to witness a compelling and mature story being part of a turn-based RPG as it was in Lost Odyssey as well (FFX back in 2001 was also already pretty mature as a videogame, and the first Final Fantasy with dubbed characters, yet FF titles are generally received as more light-hearted novels) back in 2007. So now we have this behemoth of a Je'RPG (yes you read it right) redefining the mechanics and pretty much giving a fresh coat of depth that we, as RPG/JRPG fans, didn't even knew we wanted, giving us such a vast degree of freedom in creating classes and builds that, for the genre, I think it will go unmatched for quite some time. Did I already mentioned that you can potentially parry or dodge EVERY attack that  ANY enemy throws at you? Yeah, well, now I did. So, not only it gives you an insurmountable amount of content for party members to experiment with and passive points that let you create synergies between your weapons and your skills, but it also tells you that, if you \"git gud\", you can overcome every difficulty! (except maybe one fuckin fuck of a fucker eh-eeeeeh boi).\n\n[b] - Soundtrack - [/b]\nThe score in CO:E33 is just as fitting as you can imagine for the living people of the french nation, with a couple of headbangers mixed inside a mostly orchestral soundtrack that (sadly) features a lot of french lyrics (CAN YOU BELIEVE THE GUTS ON THEM FOR DOING SO?). As I've seen in a video covering the development of the game, the composer was at his first project, not even specifying if big or small, just [u]literally[/u] his first work ever on a videogame or production of some sort, casually dropping a career defining collection of musical pieces, and that's insane. Yeah...I really don't know what to say no more, so here's a bunch of french words to sooth your mind: [i]baguette, croissant, mon coeur, sacre bleu, tour de france, parfum, pomme de terre[/i] (and so MANY more, don't get me started).\n\n[b] - Graphics/Art Direction - [/b]\nAs far as I'm concerned, the visuals of this game are my only gripe, because they both look very impressive...but also very terrible. The lighting in the environment is managed pretty badly most of the times, but it makes a full 360¬∞ twist when switching to a cutscene or while having a close up dialogue, giving you a sense of inspiration being taken from the 40's well acquainted tasteful classy romantic voulez vous coucher avec moi french movie in an instant. It has got brilliant cutscenes and facial expressions, the enemies and inhabitants of the world that are not human-shaped are peculiar to say the least, but also very charming (Esquie is a brilliant example of this), and I kinda love it because it doesn't remind me of anything in particular and it feels like it was purposely painted for this game. The world building is generous and fulfilling without going on forever, which is a plus for me, presenting a decent variety between scenarios.\n\n[h2] It is pretty [i] Clair [/i] that this Expedition is [i] Obscur...33.[/i] [/h2]\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a complete work of art that checks a lot of boxes for me, made by a dedicated production of very well passionate individuals making the most of their experience, and it's a remarkable achievement for me personally to look at this game, to think that it's actually holding up despite the limitations it had and the fierce competition that could have easily outshined this project if it was more focused on making games for the fun of it instead of being led by petty monetary gain. In the end, the good aspects completely nullify some technical and graphical artifacts that the Unreal Engine 5 managed to bring over. \n\nWith that said,\nI'm giving Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 \n10 very soft and fluffy on the inside but \nsolid and crunchy on the outside freshly baked baguettes out of 10.\n(which is the highest possible rating in France)\nEnjoy while it's fresh!\n",

The characters felt like real people, dialogue felt fluid and natural, and the ending tore me in two with the final decision. One of the only times i will give props to the French for great quality work.",

It's definitely not GOTY as many might say here. There are fricking KCD2 and DS2 this year what GOTY are you talking about? I even got interested in this game because some called it a GOTY lol. Come on, I finished 100% of the game but still I did not find a good competition to KCD2, though I can agree that Clar Obscur: Expedition 33 is superior in artwork (it basicallly has more artistic freedom plotwise) but the game pales in comparison in other art directions, i.e. cinematography.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I expected WAY more from this based on all the talks but putting it all aside I definitely enjoyed it for what it offers, I even 100%-ed it! Though not GOTY but it represents jrpg genre very well\r\n\r\nSystem recommendations. \r\nRan it on R5 7600x 16gb ddr5 RTX3080ti and sata ssd. I still used DLSS a little (like 75% was raw raster) because 1 location (\"Stone Wave Cliffs\" I believe) was running with low FPS (felt like a bit under 30). But otherwise there was no complaint for a 100% run",

        "review": "(Minor Spoilers)\n\nIt takes a really special piece of media for me to listen/watch/play for an extended period of time. \nI can never find myself enjoying sitting down and consuming a single piece of media for too long. \nI don't really know how I got to this point, maybe I have addled my brain with too much time spent watching short form content that my attention span has been reduced to nothing. \nMaybe it's that I am getting older and have less time after work to indulge in such pleasures.\n\nFor example I play a match of War Thunder, die within 1 minute into the match, I still have reserve vehicles which I can continue playing but I find myself just ALT+F4'ing and going onto another game.\nConversely I could have just finished a 40-60 minute DotA 2 match, clawing our way back from near defeat all the way to assured victory and destroying the enemy team, so even though I would be riding that sweet dopamine ride of victory I very rarely would think to myself and say \"Yes, another\"\nInstead I'll quit and move onto the next game.\nPlay for a bit and either get bored or frustrated.\nThen move on to the next game.\nRinse and repeat.\nEven when I play with friends I find the longer I play a game with them the more I start to want to play another game, and that makes the current game feel like it is dragging me down\nI know that sounds dumb, but I guess that is just how my brain works.\n\nWhich means (for me at least) any media that makes me  WANT to play longer is truly special in my eyes.\n\nAnd that is the case with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33\n\nThere was a lot of talk about how good this game was since launch, how critics are claiming this is a GOTY contender from the very moment it burst onto the market.\nAnd in an era of AAA publishers pushing half baked bug infested games to market and fixing them after launch, Clair Obscur was a breath of fresh air.\nNow, I am by no means a critic, I leave such detailed analysis to my brother who is far more experienced in delving into the intricacies of what separates the good media to consume from the bad.\nHe quite often recommends pieces of media he thinks I would enjoy, and despite how stubborn I can be to listen to him, he is right 99% of the time.\n\nMy brother didn't need to convince me to play Clair Obscur.\n\nThere were many things that drew me into wanting to play this game.\nThe social media hype.\nThe critical acclaim.\nThe art design.\nThe gameplay.\nThe fact I got a new PC and wanted it to flex its muscle on games at ultra quality at 1440p.\n\nBut what actually did it for me is that I'm a sucker for sound tracks.\n\n\nI don't know how Sandfall Interactive did it but they managed to get a composer who has never done work on Video games before and say \"fuck it\" and produce 150+ tracks for this game.\n\nAll of them are great tracks\nSome are even amazing tracks\nA few are absolutely certified BANGERS.\nA truly astonishing feat for a western game and Lorien Testard should receive all the praise he deserves.\n\nWhich coming from a Kiwi is saying something (IYKYK).\n\nThe sound track along with the performances from the voice actors made me find myself constantly and consistently getting shivers right as the moment hits during the cut scene.\nTwo in particular, Lumi√®re and Une vie √† t'aimer shine out.\n\nLumi√®re being what in my eyes (or ears in this case) is the Leitmotif for the whole game.\nThe constant call backs and subtle changes to it you hear throughout the game make this piece a central part to the story, and the main track by itself is just an actual masterpiece.\nAlice Duport-Percier's voice is immaculate and I now constantly find myself humming \"dim dim dah da di dim dim dah\" all the time now as a result.\n\nBut then there is Une vie √† t'aimer.\nWhen it comes to video game music, there is a certain song from a certain JRPG that is universally praised by all.\nSo when people call this song the French One Winged Angel it just shows you how fucking hard this song goes.\nTHIS is how you make music for boss fights, I can't remember the last time playing a game and just completely enthralled the music. \nA song that has both a male and female vocalist absolutely going at it is a perfect metaphor for the game, which if you know the story you would realise how seriously poetic this along with the other vocalised soundtracks are.\n\nThe sound track is just *chefs kiss* overall, and if it doesn't win best sound track of the year somebody needs to see what kind of drugs Geoff Keighley is taking.\n\nNow finally the game play.\nI am still not sure if Clair Obscur is technically a JRPG, but whatever it is, it is basically the western equivalent of it.\nEither way I am no stranger to JRPG's and souls like games, I have been a fan of Pokemon since I was 7, and I have begrudgingly played through the Dark Souls trilogy and still have my sanity, although souls-like games aren't my go to style of game, I am definitely not opposed to them.\n\nBut playing this game just hits different.\n\nEach playable character's play style is so unique, and trying to find those perfect synergies with each other was really fun to finally hone in on, and then satisfying to watch as you pummel the enemies into oblivion.\nTheir move sets are flashy, are great to watch, and the quick time events to use the moves keeps you just as engaged using the moves as you are when trying to dodge the enemies moves.\n\nOverall game design and world building figuratively (and literally) a work of art, no two game levels ever feel the same and it was fun to explore them fully and finding those little secret areas of the level that gave rewards via lore drops or new items.\n\nThe world map is fun to navigate, I like seeing inaccessible parts in beginning areas as that gets you back tracking once you progress further in the story to find those hidden goodies that were tantalisingly out of reach just before.\n\nThe game loop is fresh, there are a wide range of enemies that all have unique move sets, and that feeling of facing the unknown when it comes to a new enemy happens fairly often, not knowing the timings on the dodges can be real nerve racking to get down right and frustrating when you don‚Äôt (in a good way).\n\nThere were always those mini bosses you can face, special ‚Äúchroma‚Äù versions of enemies you can find that are far tougher to beat, they often expand on the regular version‚Äôs move sets which can catch you out, especially if you aren‚Äôt expecting a 4th or 5th hit in what is normally a 3 hit combo for the standard version of the enemy.\n\n\nThe main group of characters each have their charm and touching backstory that really makes you invested in their outcome. \nPlaying through the Prologue you really understand what they are all fighting for, each year everyone of a certain age effectively gets Thanos snapped, and your expedition, so full of hope, is determined to put an end to it.\nWhich seeing what happens at the start and end of Act 1 a real fucking heart breaker.\nThe expedition starts off landing right into an ambush and all but the playable characters survive.\nAnd then at the end of act 1, you have who you think is the main character just get fucking OWNED.\nIn fact the ending cut scenes of both act 1 and act 2 left me lost for words.\nBoth story events that happened really turned everything I thought I knew about the story and how I thought it was going to play out in its head.\n\n\nIt really showed that this game was gonna take you for a ride emotionally (in a good way) and made me really invested in the story to see what came next.\n\nI do hope they make a sequel, or at the very least a DLC.\nI still haven‚Äôt fully finished the game, just the main story.\n\nSo I am looking forward to jumping back in to see what parts I missed, and more importantly see how much damage I can get Maelle to do.\n\n10/10 game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I'm going into this entirely blind and plan to keep it that way.\n\nGood god what a start.\n\nI just finished BG3, and while it's one of my favorite games I've played in the last 10 years, this game could potentially blow it out of the water.\n\n  I'll update this review when I finish it, but I highly doubt my mind will change.",

From a story perspective, it gave me vibes of Nier Automata (I enjoyed Expedition 33 more). From a gameplay perspective, this is like Paper Mario or Super Mario RPG with the turn-based/active combat system.\n\n+ Great music, great visuals, great story, and great characters.\n+ I like how the full team can be used (if your main team dies in combat, you can bring in the remaining members to win the fight)\n+ Item usage is good, refreshes at checkpoints so no need to stockpile healing items throughout the playthrough.\n+ Stable, no real crashes.\n+ All characters feel balanced in combat, and I enjoyed playing and leveling everyone up throughout my playthroughs.\n\n- The pacing near the end of the game (around final Act) is confusing. I suggest once you get to this Act where everything opens up, you should resist the urge to do all optional content before facing the final boss and just go straight to the boss. You can go back and complete the side content afterwards without any issue.\n- The relationship system breaks me out of immersion a bit - I wish it just naturally happened instead of being something you opt into.",

        "review": "This game is artistically beautiful, between the music, visuals, and cutscenes, it's easy to see why people can be so captivated with its presentation.  I've seen many people calling this game a masterpiece, and it's a little hard to argue otherwise!  The positives certainly outweigh the negatives, but I don't think that means this game is without fault, either.\n\nOne thing I will mention is that I think that while the level design is beautiful, it is also kind of a hassle to navigate.  Every area has *dozens* of dead-ends with loot to be found or mini-bosses to fight, most of which aren't too important.  But then sometimes you'll miss Energizing Start 2, find Energizing Start 3 later, and realize you missed an incredibly important staple item and have to go backtrack to get it.  You might have scenarios like this happen to you multiple times throughout the game.  It's annoying!\n\nThat aside, the RPG combat might be what I'm *most* conflicted by.  I played this game on Expert up until the final boss of Act 2, where I finally got tired of this game's reliance on parry mechanics.  This game really showcases the negatives of the \"parrification\" of modern games where attacks are intentionally designed to be misleading, just to increase the difficulty of parrying successfully.\n\nI *love* how unique each character is, and there is a lot of customization available for each character and how you want to play them.  However, since parrying is what generates the most AP, the flow of the game is greatly hampered if you aren't parrying most attacks that come your way.  To the game's defense, there *are* ways to generate more AP by simply face-tanking everything, but Expert mode's damage is so high that it's very difficult to get to that point.  Overall I found the gameplay to be the weakest part of this game, and it's entirely due to the enemy design.\n\nThe story is pretty good and has a good amount of depth, and I think the primary antagonist is incredibly well written.  I won't go into much detail about Acts 1 and 2, but the game is able to flip between charming and funny moments while maintaining a constant undertone of melancholy.  Going full into Act 3 spoilers, but [spoiler] the ending left me feeling conflicted, and I think the reason stems from the decision to let the player choose between two endings.\n\nThis is a deeply personal story of the grief of Verso's family, and it feels very weird that you, the player, who had no input in the story up until this point, make a binary choice to decide their fate.  Either Maelle stays in her fictional painted world, or Verso is finally put to rest, allowing the family to come together again to grieve.  \n\nI dislike the decision to force a final fight between these two because of what it means for the one you *didn't* choose.  Either Verso is effectively a prisoner to Maelle who cannot let go of the past, or Verso pushes Maelle away without convincing her to finally let go. Both options feel like a poor resolution for the other party, and I would have preferred a single ending where the two can come together and accept whatever the final outcome is. [/spoiler]\n\nI think this is absolutely a game worth giving a play, and I'm glad to have finished it.",

I must admit it was first later in the game that I wanted to try and understand one of the companions fighting style.... But this is a postive as it adds variety to the gameplay",

The games atmosphere was incredible, it gives you a unique experience that I haven't felt from another game in a really long time. The story? \"Absolute Cinema\" as folks like to say. It does a great job weaning you into the world and building from it into something deeper. I couldn't predict majority of anything and it kept me on my toes. The music was so beautiful and fits the theme so well, tragically dark. The fact that such a small team put this title together is astounding and they deserve every ounce of hype that they get from this game.\n\nI hope to see a lot more from this studio if they keep this passion going. I would buy it 5 times over.",

        "review": "Clair Obscur is an incredible game with an in-depth complicated story. If you finish it...\n\nThe story will keep you in the dark for 90% of the playthrough. Which in my opinion is a poor flaw in the writing. You won't understand what is happening until 15 hours into the game. They give small hints, here and there, but nothing that will allow you to understand the overall grandiose plot. Once, the plot is finally revealed, everything instantly becomes better and more enjoyable. It just a shame that it takes so long to understand. \n\nPersonally, the game was a struggle to continue forward with and I would have stopped if it wasn't for the hype that surrounded it. The combat system of turn-based isn't my favorite. Although they did make it interesting with it's complexity, that I honestly, didn't fully understand.\n\nThere is so much love and time that was put into Clair Obscur, and it shows that the gaming industry isn't dead. When you have a small team that is passionate about their work , this is what it produces. This game is worth the money, and honestly deserves to be game of the year.",

        "review": "Incredible game, changed my views on the French. 9/10 beacuse it could've been even better in a few places.\r\n\r\nBy far the best part of this game are the characters, the game just makees you really care for them and you yourself want to see them succeed. They all are just amazing and honestly I wish they did more stuff with em! Lune Sciel lose plot relevence after about halfway through act 2 and Monoco doesn't really have much stuff do to overall. Fortunately the side quests and camp interactions help it a bit but I really wish they had more plot relevence beacuse as I said after beating about 60% of the game the main plot focuses on Maelle and Verso (which is done amazingly for the record). The story overall is SO fucking good like bro ah it makes you think about it for days but I don't want to spoil you too much. I really loved finding the journals of previous expeditions and their flags, just learning what our predecesors did is really nice. Unfortunately the game fails a bit in this regard, the enviornmental story telling would have been A LOT better imo if the bodies we find would have the corresponding numbers on their bands. They do have em in cutscenes but normally they're just empty so every body we find looks about the same, it's not much of an issue really but would have been an amazing detail. Another great thing is the combat, I've played many jrpgs over the years and this game probably has one of the best there is, just, amazing and satysfying. Honestly thank God this game is turnbased beacuse the hitboxes are terrible LMAO. What does that mean? Well basically in the overworld you can find nooks and crannies which you think you can enter but oops invisible wall, you have an attack to get an advantage in fights but it's hitboxes are ASS, it's hitboxes is about 2/3 of the size of the attacks animation and the parkour. Oh God the parkour. There aren't many parkouring segments so it's not really that big of a deal but the grabbing ledges mechanic doesn't work correctly I think (especially during exploration). You often have to walk around to get somewhere even tho in theory your character should be able to grab the ledge, it often gets a bit frustrating when you find those Gestral challanges where you have to pray the character will grab onto the ledge and not bounce off of it. Jumping isn't good overall beacuse you lose control of your character mid air and after you hit the ground your character does a roll which you can't stop, you can turn mid air to affect the way where your character will go aftere dropping but it's pretty janky. The music tho guys the music is SOOOO GEWS MMMM. I forgot to talk about the locations, they're awesome! The setting is really cool and what happens in it is just so... Magical. Sorry if this review seems too negative, I really love this game and it's just almost perfect, the gestral challanges aren't even that hard for the record and there's not much platforming in this game so it's not really an issue but when it is it's not good.\r\n\r\nFor those who come after.\r\nSilksong better tho <3",

From the gameplay to the visuals to the soundtrack, everything here feels like a love letter to those who came before as well as a beautiful example for those who come after.\r\n\r\nIf you want a solid combat system, here you go. Good story? I cried within the first hour, and felt things no other game has made me feel in a bit. Music? The sheer amount of tracks and differences between variations of each song is astounding. Graphics? Do you see the cover art? the game pretty much looks that good the whole way through. There's not a single place I've looked that made me think \"that could've been a little more detailed..\"\r\n\r\nI could (and have) rant about this game for hours on end, I don't even write reviews and here I am writing one for this game because it truly deserves every bit of praise it gets.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, is it perfect? No, nothing is. Is it worth your hard earned money? Yes, yes it is. Do you need to be good at games to enjoy it? No, there's a story mode difficulty for people who don't want to pull their hair out! (it was also requested by Jennifer English, the English voice of Maelle who also voices Shadowheart in Baldur's Gate 3)\r\n\r\nP.S. If you read through all of this, drink some water, get a snack, and have a good day! :)",

Very little to complain about.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty was a little weird for me. First off - when it tells you that mastering Parry/Dodge is helpful but not mandatory for normal difficulty, they are absolutely lying. If you don't hit the majority of your parries, you will die. A lot. It is doable, but I found it tedious. So I ended up dropping it down to easy, but that was way too easy. Damage dropped down to about 1/10 what I was taking in normal, every semblance of challenge was gone. I'll take a too easy game over too hard / tedious, but I really would have liked a setting in between the two.\r\n\r\nAlso Act 3. I did what it told me to do, and the game ended. Took like an hour or two. Maybe there's a bunch of optional stuff out there that didn't really get hinted at, but as far as mandatory content it could've just been stuck at the end of Act 2.",

The parry and dodge system feels unique for tbc, and it‚Äôs easily one of the best games out there when it comes to character builds; you can turn any character into an absolute powerhouse.\n\nThere‚Äôs a ton of endgame content and even a New Game+ mode to keep you hooked. The story captures the spirit of classic JRPGs with some truly amazing plot twists; some you might see coming, and others that will completely catch you off guard.\n\nThe characters are all lovable and funny, supported by some of the best voice acting I‚Äôve ever heard in a game. The animations are impressively lifelike and fluid, avoiding the stiffness that npcs have in so many titles.\n\nThe world itself is massive and artistic, like exploring a living painting. can‚Äôt wait for a sequel.",

This is what AAA games wish they were doing, honestly. Give me more Clair Obscur & turn based games over all the slop that the gaming industry has been pumping out lately! 10/10, will recommend to EVERYONE!",

With my play style it took me slightly under a hundred hours to complete the game.  \r\n\r\nOn Steam it has an \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" rating, the highest possible and I have to say that the game more than lives up to that rating.\r\n\r\nIf you love a character-driven story with emotion and heart, this game dives deeply into complex characters and their evolving relationships.  Twists and turns in the story carry emotional weight of heroism and heartache.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the music is exceptional and deeply emotionally moving using classical instruments and sonorous female vocals.  The artist is exceptional with the wonderfully vivid imaginations of the developers bringing the world to life in and wondrously immersive way.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for something to add to your list of games to play, I would highly recommend this one.  Although, I'll give no spoilers as that would cheat you of the innocent wonder of playing this game without any preconceptions...",

Had a lot of fun with this one and would recommend folks to give it a try and not let the turn based combat turn you away. It's more engaging than your regular turn based and requires you to pay attention to perform dodges and parries.",

I loved watching the characters interact with each other and grow. The writing and story were written so well. This has the best turned based combat in any game I have played. All of the skills were unique and have lots of synergy with each other. The continent was huge and I loved exploring every location. Side quests were very fun and game had lots of side content.

Enjoyable turn based combat that keeps things active so it feels a lot better than the dusty old turn based jrpg approach.  The only bad thing I can say about the game is that sometimes trying to grab a ledge just doesn't work for whatever reason and during some of the parkour stuff it makes you want to rip your hair out, other than that it's amazing.  There is a reason this is everyone's game of the year, it is actually that good, if you are questioning it, just get it.  Definitely worth it.",

This game got me out of a stuck period of 15 years... gaming wise.\n\nIm 36 and I have been gaming for at least 30 of those years and I can safely say that I have never played a game as inpactful as Clair Obscure.\n\nIf you havent played it, play it.\n\nOne word of advice: you dont need to parry, but its really fun, it IS audio based more than visual though and you need to listen for the timing instead of looking for it in a lot of cases. Which is actually more satisfying than if it were visual.\n\nIs it perfect? Yes.",

Not only is the game beautiful, not only is the game play fast paced and frenetic while also having deep tactics, and not only does the game have one of the most amazing soundtracks of the decade, it also has a story that is far deeper and emotionally evocative than you could believe.\r\n\r\nClair Obscur is a game that is difficult to talk about, because there's almost nothing to say that won't spoil moments from the story that are worth experiencing for yourself.  To put things simply, this is a masterpiece of a game.  It's fun, it looks amazing, it sounds amazing, it's written fantastically, it manages to have the proper amount of tonal shifts to keep you engaged and not make you numb to the story beats, and the game is going to ask you to make decisions that don't have perfect outcomes.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that this game has issues with is the ultimate boss you can choose to fight, that is so difficult compared the rest of the game that it essentially requires you to create a kind of cheat build to accomplish.  I just recommend avoiding it, because it doesn't add anything of value to the story.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I recommend that you complete the game prior to doing optional side content, as the game is really set up with this expectation in mind.  I completed the game after doing all the side content, and it was so easy that even after setting the final boss to 100X health, turning off healing, and getting rid of some of my better abilities, the final boss was too easy.  So, do that before you do the side content to get the best end game experience",

The level design is also not that good and some parts looks the same just copy and paste. It's tiring to fight hard bosses back to back especially on expert difficulty(hardest difficulty) that's why it's best to play in short bursts(2-5hrs) per week. The game shines in combat and story. It has ups and downs but overall the experience was pleasant will recommend if you like parrying and turn based combat.",

Those who know not, that they are not.[/b]\r\n\r\n[i]For those who come after.[/i]\r\n\r\nI have wandered through countless worlds, but none have captured my soul quite like this. This is not merely a game ‚Äî it‚Äôs a masterpiece of emotion, art and sound. The story unfolds like a living painting ‚Äî emotional, unpredictable and deeply human. Every step feels like part of something greater, something meticulously crafted. You can feel the love that went into every corner of this game. It's clearly a passion project of epic proportions ‚Äî crafted for gamers by gamers.\r\n\r\nThe visual design is stunning ‚Äî a world painted in light and shadow, beauty and sorrow. The combat is a dance of creativity and control, with each character offering build possibilities that invite experimentation.\r\n\r\nThe bosses ‚Äî each one a spectacle of art and challenge, unforgettable encounters that demand not only skill but understanding. However the difficulty curve is a little funky. Every now and then you run into some really hard enemies but you scale kinda fast and at a certain point you can just one shot everything.\r\n\r\nAnd the music is phenomenal, perfectly complementing every emotional beat, boss fight and tranquil moment. It's a love letter to both players and game composers. At times, it doesn‚Äôt even feel like a game ‚Äî it feels like a living musical, where every step and every sound are part of the same grand performance.\r\n\r\nThis is more than a game. It's an experience. A great adventure.\r\n[b]A masterpiece ‚Äî without question, GOTY![/b]\r\n\r\n[i]Mes amis, the journey will hopefully continue soon.[/i]\r\nExpedition 33 ‚Äî complete.",

Not a product to extract as much money as possible from you while delivering an unpolished experience, but a work of art that is fun and engaging. Everything from the story, the characters, the writing, the environments, and the combat. Very reminiscent of JRPGs of yesteryear. It isn't just turn based, though; you're actively interacting during each animation through parrying, dodging and QTEs. As you learn about each character and the world at large, you feel a genuine connection to each and every one. A story full of loss and grief yet having to push onward in spite of it. It is a brilliant experience and one that I will think about for a long time.\r\n\r\n\"For those who come after.\"",

For it being a pretty linear game there is plenty to explore. Story is phenomenal with a nice blend of serious but light moments as well. No point in making a long review no one will read, but this game is a breath of fresh air.",

Plot develops beautifully to a tough and unexpected choice the players are forced to make. Honestly, the story alone is worth playing through the campaign. \n\nIf you like the core game play of a turn based game with real time elements for dodge/parry then you are a fool to not give them your money right now.\n\nIts a full finished game with no BS cosmetics for sale.\n\nSTOP READING AND BUY",

It lost me midway through act 2 or whenever it was when I lost one of the characters and Clone Replacement #2 stepped right in.\n\nThe combat is \"all right\". I liked the cards system... Maybe. But I never got any really great builds figured out. So every battle was mostly using roughly the same tactic over and over and it started to get boring.\n\n6.5/10\n\nI'll give it a thumbs up because I think many other people will like it, but I need more from a narrative journey and the tactical combat just wasn't picking up the slack.",

But it's turn based, and yet you kinda need to be active at all times to parry and dodge.\r\nBecause of this, I'd note that this game is just flat out not going to be for everyone, it takes a certain kind of mentality to enjoy, and I'm not going to argue with someone who found it difficult or annoying - for a lot of people, it will be.\r\nBut if anything about this game appeals to you at all, you'll probably see why people love it.",

Yes this game is that good and this game is a good scale to see if award shows or review sites / videos are legitimate or not.\n\nIt is a visually stunning and unique game, the gameplay and systems are unique and the story - at least for the first 2 acts is amazing. More importantly it is fun and has a gravitas behind it which is hard to explain. It had quite a few WOW moments too which is always welcome. \n\nI have my comments about act 3 but I respect their choices. This gaming company is now on my very very short list of companies I will pre-order from. They have shown themselves to have what I call the true spirit of what game developers should be. Well done!\n\n",

Despite only 15 min into the game I got somehow attached to these characters and got me emotional deep inside\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢ For those who love turn-based jrpg (to my millennial bros and sis), this game is for us. What makes this even better is the parry and dodge mechanics. There's a real-time defensive mechanics that rewards players when reacting to enemy patterns correctly.\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢ Dozens of optional bosses and locations with god like rewards. It doesn't feel repetitive.\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢ 10/10 OST!!!!! Especially the Une vie √† t'aimer. Stun locks players on the first few sec. Une vie √† peindre is also good my goodness!!!!\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢ In my opinion, the length of this game is just perfect. Not too long but definitely not short.\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢ Story- I got a mix reaction for this, Act 1 and Act 2 is awesome but before going to Act 3 that's where I got to say... eh? what the heck is this story. This is stupid! Then after finishing this story. BRAVO! Absolute Cinema!!!! 10/10! Even side stories are great!\r\n\r\nAnd finally, growing up and having a family. Games now just don't hit the same anymore like they used to. Until I play and finish this game. I don't usually do this stuff but I beat this game on PS5. Out of respect for making me feel something again on video games I brought this game here on Steam. ^_^ This is definitely my Game of the Year.",

It hooked me from the start menu with \"Alicia.\" It made laugh, it made me cry (mostly cry, but I good and memorable ways) and almost throw my controller at it when I lost at one of the minigames (again). \n\nThe gameplay is addictive,  the characters, story and world building are fantastic and the music is just next level.

I never want it to end.\n\nIf you like Paper Mario or Super Mario RPG or Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga combat, where it's turn based with reaction commands and dodging/blocking, you will almost certainly like this. Excellent story, world, dialogue, combat, art style/aesthetics, music. The only issues with this game are tiny little nit picky things here and there. If you just look at the broad strokes this is about as perfect a game as I have ever played.\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n\n\n33/10\nGenuinely one of the best games of all time.

This is not merely a game ‚Äî it‚Äôs a masterpiece of emotion, art, and sound. The story unfolds like a living painting ‚Äî emotional, unpredictable, and deeply human. Every step feels like part of something greater, something meticulously crafted. It‚Äôs easily the greatest game I‚Äôve ever played.\r\n\r\nThe visual design is nothing short of stunning ‚Äî a world painted in light and shadow, beauty and sorrow. The combat is a dance of creativity and control, with each character offering build possibilities that invite experimentation yet feel perfectly balanced.\r\n\r\nThe bosses  ‚Äî each one a spectacle of art and challenge, unforgettable encounters that demand not only skill but understanding. Every victory feels earned, every defeat a lesson written in elegance.\r\n\r\nAnd the music ‚Äî my god, the music. By far the most beautiful and intentional soundtracks I‚Äôve ever heard in a game. It doesn‚Äôt just accompany the story ‚Äî it becomes part of it. Every note feels planned, every silence meaningful. At times, it doesn‚Äôt even feel like a game ‚Äî it feels like a living musical, where every step and every sound are part of the same grand performance.\r\n\r\nThis is more than a game. Its an experience. A great adventure.\r\nA flawless masterpiece ‚Äî without question, Game of the Year.\r\n\r\nEnd of Log.

        "review": "Personal GOTY 2025 and so refreshing to see a rly new and unique IP/new story game (srsly game is not short but if the main story was at least ~twice as long it would have been a perfect game).\r\nAlso a great example of what AAA games should be (full game in the base game, no cashgrab \"mandatory story/side quest dlcs\" while still offering additional DLCs that u can get to support the devs and honestly I never have anything against additional skins, artwork or soundtrack dlcs)\r\n\r\n+ Turn based combat done perfectly (srsly parry, perf parry, evade, jump and gradient counter, just amazing!)\r\n+ Every char has their unique fighting style and skills and this is done soooooo great! I loved it! Its rly amazing as whoever u put in the party u always have 3 chars with very different yet compatible playstyle! (Even tho some might not sit with u at first after a few fights/skill unlocks u will like all chars/styles. I rly like all of them even tho I might pref some more but didn't dislike any of them!)\r\n+ Very nice difficulty (til mid act 1 its 2 easy yes, but gets nicely challenging after it. I legit had parts where I put all 3 or 4-5 out of 6 points into defense lol)\r\n+ Great interesting story (altho personally I didn't like every twist/thing you find out in the world they build). \r\n+ Great gameplay loop, be it longer story cutscenes, multiple battles before I leave the current area and exploring whatever area I was in (rly trying to find all secrets and beat all enemies found)\r\n+ Great chars (altho kinda dislike some of Gustaves early post tutorial decisions/thoughts)\r\n+ Beautiful map and locations (u can see a lot of love was put into every single corner)\r\n+ Exploring is always rewarded (except if u ignore and enter a \"danger\" zone on the main map 2 early in which case ur f**ck*d) and every corner has something for you to find\r\n+ Nice optional puzzles/fun challenges\r\n+- Decent length (depending on ur skill I'd say 25-30h to finish the main story and yeah playin on easy doesn't count as playing), honestly wish the main story was at least 50h long\r\n+ End game content (kinda feel like end game content is ~40+% of the whole game)\r\n- Game like this should have rly been longer in the way that it had a lot more \"game\" before the finale and before the end game content (I rly wish they expanded the story further and put most of the endgame content into the main story before the finale + they rly had few bigger story points that they could have resolved separately with that). Once I beat the game I kinda lost part of the interest as there was no purpose in doing the end game stuff (yes post end content is mostly rly fun, but some felt like a chore as u needed to lv up to be able to do it without 10h long battles where u must evade almost everything, even tho I rly wanted to beat it all and enjoy the adventure I felt less motivated to do so after seeing the ending). I even was thinking of trying the \"danger\" areas before the finale as I somehow wanted to have the side content done before the finale.\r\n+ Additional skins/hairstyles to find\r\n- Sadly most of the skins/hairstyles are the same across (i.e. u unlock ponytail for Lune which looks exaclty like Maelle's and u will 99% unlock the same ponytail for Ciel later, only difference is the hair color xd). Honestly wouldn't even say this is a con if we had more \"uniquer looking\" skins and hairs to find (even if some or most were still \"shared\" then)\r\n\r\n9/10 for me",

        "review": "The game that first got me into RPGs was the Legend of Dragoon and I was instantly reminded of that combat style when I saw a preview of Expedition 33. Although the combat style is similar, it's definitely not the same as the timing button presses go with abilities in this whereas they went with regular attacks in Legend of Dragoon. My gripe with the timing of this game is that they seem to be random as oppose to going with the movement of the character during the ability cast. The combat is quite a bit more complex with Luminas and the ability to equip more passively and weapon passives that can completely change how a character plays aside from just simply choosing other abilities to use in combat. \r\n\r\nThis game feels almost like a blend of a JRPG with dark souls with very frequent boss fights and irregular attack patterns from enemies. \r\n\r\nFrequent boss fights - There are sometimes two or three in a row which I'm not a huge fan of personally. I prefer the more JRPG approach of building up to a boss and having them less frequent. \r\n\r\nIrregular attack patterns - The game has 3 ways to deal with enemy attacks: Parry, dodge and jump. At the beginning of the game, dodging seems pretty useless since it's like a parry but no counter attack but later on you find out there are specific attacks that necessitate a dodge. I'm a huge fan of this variety in button timing for defence. What I don't like is how the timing of the button push is right before the attack and not the timing of when the attack hits you so that throws off my timing every now and then. In addition, enemies sometimes do feign attacks or weird movements so you might parry/dodge unnecessarily, which is fine, but a lot of fights are less about timing skill and more about memorising the attack patterns. Meaning I highly doubt you can play this game in 1 playthrough without getting hit (obviously without a guide too). \r\n\r\nAll in all, this is a great game with nice graphics, fantastic music, fun side quests and a great story. It doesn't quite scratch that legend of dragoon itch for me, though I acknowledge it's its own game and should be considered as such. I still highly recommend it for turn-based RPG fans.",

        "review": "\"Clair Obscur\" is a story that often captivates with its atmosphere and thematic depth. Here's a breakdown:\n\nPlus Points (Strengths):\n\nAtmospheric Storytelling: The story excels in creating a specific mood, often utilizing vivid descriptions and sensory details. This can draw the reader into the world and enhance their emotional connection to the narrative.\n\nThematic Exploration: \"Clair Obscur\" frequently delves into complex themes such as identity, memory, loss, and the nature of reality. This can provide readers with plenty to contemplate and discuss.\n\nCharacter Development: The characters are often well-developed, with internal conflicts and growth that resonate with readers. Their relationships and interactions can be a significant draw.\n\nUnique Narrative Structure: The story might employ an unconventional narrative structure, such as flashbacks, multiple perspectives, or fragmented timelines, which can add intrigue and keep the reader engaged.\n\nSymbolism and Imagery: The use of symbolism and evocative imagery enriches the story, providing layers of meaning and encouraging deeper interpretation.\n\nMinus Points (Weaknesses):\n\nPacing Issues: The story might suffer from pacing problems, with sections that feel slow or drag on, potentially losing the reader's interest.\n\nVagueness and Ambiguity: While thematic depth is a strength, excessive vagueness can be frustrating. If the story is too abstract or unclear, it may alienate some readers.\n\nCharacter Flaws: While complex characters are good, if the characters' actions or motivations aren't believable, it can undermine the narrative.\n\nUnresolved Plotlines: The story might leave certain plot threads or questions unanswered, which can be unsatisfying for readers who prefer a sense of closure.\n\nOver-reliance on Style: Sometimes, the focus on style and atmosphere can overshadow the plot or character development, leaving the story feeling superficial.",

It feels surreal, like you‚Äôre walking through a dream that makes no sense but somehow keeps pulling you in. Honestly, it‚Äôs both amazing and a little messed up. I kept thinking whoever made this world must‚Äôve been in a strange headspace.\r\n\r\nThe world itself is huge and gorgeous, but I got lost constantly. I walked in circles more times than I can count/remember. This game needs a mini-map or at least something to help guide you. Half the time I had no clue where I was going, but somehow I still found the next area LOL.\r\n\r\nThe story starts off super depressing, so if you‚Äôre already feeling down, maybe wait to play this one. It does get better later, but it stays pretty gloomy all the way through. Certainly not my type.\r\n\r\nSome bosses and elite enemies are insanely tough, but if you enjoy challenges... you'll love it. It actually feels rewarding when you finally beat them. There are so many skills and Pictons to pick from. It‚Äôs a lot to figure out but fun to mess with.\r\n\r\nThe music is incredible, with legit high-quality classical tracks. Some are dark, some are light, and all of them fit perfectly. You can tell they put a lot of effort into it.\r\n\r\nI haven‚Äôt finished exploring everything yet, and honestly, I‚Äôm not sure I ever will. But this game is one of the most unique things I‚Äôve played. Confusing, beautiful, emotional, and completely different. Huge respect to the devs for creating something this bold.",

From the the very start the visuals caught my attention, there where moments where I would just stand in one spot mesmerized by the sheer beauty of the landscape not to mention the OST made me tear up at certain points. The game play itself  was very addicting, I would stay up all night grinding and learning the patterns of the enemies. Not only that but the complex nature of the game with its pictos and lumina system made things very interesting as I would spent hours testing new combos and builds. My only grip with the game is that the UI seemed kinda messy and hard to uderstand/see when first playing the game and the gestral games where kinda clunky but other than that fantastic game!\n\n10/10",

It's sick how even with the rather niche turn-based combat system (the real-time actions were also a great addition to it in my opinion) Sandfall managed to make a GOTY worthy title. Not to mention the soundtrack, which is phenomenal, yet calling it that feels like a massive understatement.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that I enjoyed every single second of playing this game, including the time I spent grinding for achievements (which I rarely enjoy). I loved the world, the depth, the plot, ALL of it, and I confidently recommend this game to anyone who is thinking of buying it.",

It is worth playing, but it is not deserving of all the accolades that people have given it.\n\nIf you have played turn based games ranging from Persona, to SMTV, to Metaphor, to BG, to Divinity OS2 this game has the most basic mechanics and would rank as the worst. The dodge/parry mechanic is far too significant to be a true turn based game.\n\nOverall, Ex 33 just came out at a time when AAA gaming has sucked which is why so many are excited for it.\n\nEDIT (spoiler)- Why did they kill off the only interesting character? The supporting cast have as much personality as cardboard boxes. The cut scenes at the campsite are horrible. I dont want to miss a significant part of the story and at the same time, not skipping this cut scene is torture.",

It keeps you on your feet that way you never know what is coming next.\r\n\r\nEasily game of the year if not game of the decade IMO. Honestly a must play game.",

You will not see me claim to like turn-based combat or esoteric time-wasting mechanics. But few JRPGs (yes, it is a JRPG) have the means to actually make me care about the characters. Last time I enjoyed a JRPG of any measure, it was Astlibra. This blows that out of the water and makes me want to rethink my scoring system, because I gave Nier a 9(ish)/10 but honestly this is a few levels above that for me. Vibe things, I guess. \nAs a vibe, this is a 10/10 game.",

It both ties everything together and enhances every scene, fight and zone.\n- Beautifully written story with twists and turn at every point, that just keeps you wanting for more\n- Amazing english voice actors ( I have only played the english audio version)\n- Mind blowing visual design\n- Pretty nice combat (as I am not used to this style)\n\nConclusion: I recommend this to absolutely anyone without exception!",

Don't like parrying? Stack defense / Build a healing and support char and play it like old school Final Fantasy. Want more Sekiro feeling? Use Luminas like Immaculate increasing your damage as long as you did not take damage this fight.\n\nGood for some challenge runs as well.\nThe best games will always be created by a smaller group of people building the game they want to play themselves.

As a fan of RPGs in general and notable entries being FFVIII, Legend of the Dragoon, and The Last Remnant, I mean to say this might be the best of all time. \r\n\r\nThe battle mechanics are new and fresh and have an actual learning curve. You can customize your style and even Min/Max to your hearts content. This is a true turn based system with an active component that is configurable to your desire to either set and forget or to require additional inputs for max damage. \r\n\r\nThe story is beautiful, funny, and painful all at once. It keeps you guessing if you are the type to try and figure out what is happening with the world. If instead you are the kind to let it unfold, it keeps you engaged. While most games in recent history I would play while listening to music or an audio book, I was unable to with this game as the score was alluring and audio clues enhance the experience. \r\n\r\nFinally, the game leaves you wanting more of everything. There are battles that require you to squeeze every last drop out of your characters to the point that they become broken (or rather broken in a different way.... lol), and 100% the game is difficult but not tedious. There is lore that you must chase but the world is so interesting that I cant wait for the next entry into the series. While most things are spelled out, some of the lore must be teased from between the proverbial lines and there are easter eggs hidden by the dev's that are not blatant but certainly intriguing when you grasp their meaning. The character development makes you feel for the people, and the implications of certain story line elements wrench your heart around. Overall, what an excellent game!\r\n\r\nFor those who come after...",

        "review": "Everything you've heard about this game is true. I went in almost entirely blind after this flew under my radar, and I can pretty confidently say this is now my personal favorite game, period.\n\nIt's really crazy that a game this perfect can release in the modern industry landscape: gorgeous graphics with unique and longevous art direction, optimized so well that my almost 5 year old computer can run it without issue; weighty, satisfying turn-based combat that starts simple but becomes complex and customizable the deeper into the game you get (even if endgame builds are largely one-shot based); an UNBELIEVABLE soundtrack that is going to dominate my playlist until this time next year....\n\nThe writing and characters deserve their own praise for not only being vivid and extensively fleshed out but also real, with palpable flaws and realistic reactions to/depictions of things like grief and anxiety. (I gaze longingly at party members 4 and 5). There's so much information you can infer about them and their mindsets just from watching them talk as you play.....it's entrancing. The central themes (those being grief and escapism) are very relatable and very relevant, both to the party and pretty much every character in some way shape or form. With this in mind, the way more light-hearted and comedic moments were presented to break the tension had me giggling out loud. I was laughing out loud one minute and on the verge of tears the next. This games ending is like a million daggers in your heart in the best way possible and it might be controversial to say, but I really enjoyed it. Probably the only complaint I have about the game as a whole is that I'd have appreciated a minimap for some areas (I glare directly at the Gestral Village), and that once your power spikes after getting Those Two Pictos you can pretty much curbstomp everything left in the game bar the hardest superboss (hype as shit btw).\n\nThe commentary and philosophies this game presents are genuinely incredibly engaging, and in case you forgot after all that yapping, there's a fucking masterpiece of a video game attached to it. As of writing I've defeated every superboss (again, hype as SHIT) and collected every achievement, and never once did it feel like a chore. If you have even a vague interest in turn-based combat, themes of mourning and loss, or even art as a whole; For the love of god, play this game, you will not regret it. Tomorrow comes.",

        "review": "A masterpiece of a game released in 2025. With a nostalgic turn-based combat system with a very unexpected twist of this time forcing you to engage in the otherwise mundane combat system and many mechanics that were present in classic titles like Final Fantasy, the game has not failed to evoke nostalgia factors constantly for me.\r\n\r\nAn amazing story written that is not too short and not too long, with plenty of twists that gets you hooked. The game is also kind enough to allow you to finish the game with minimal grind and has a difficulty setting which reduces damage to mere 10% definitely allows anyone to enjoy the game for its world, story and aesthetics.\r\n\r\nWhile I absolutely loved this game I do think the combat system eventually got overbearing and frustrating as the parry and dodge mechanic got cumbersome rather than enjoyable. With some optional mini bosses and bosses basically requiring full parry or fairly high successful dodge rates to even have a chance at winning the battle, this feature eventually feels more punishing than enjoyable.\r\n\r\nIf you played on normal difficulty as I did, some bosses basically end your runs the moment you miss one or two parries or dodges, and the intentional arrhythmic pattern makes it hard to predict with sound cues not being very consistent at times. Imagine playing a rhythm game and they don't accept anything less than full combo, even on your first time playing that song. That's what it sometimes feels like.\r\n\r\nThankfully there's a story mode difficulty, if you're really here just for that. With all the extra content you can do in the game and the expansive world it gives you, it's still worth it even if the combat system is frustrating.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no mini map, and it can be fairly hard to navigate around and keep track of the ever branching paths of each map and level. If you're directionally challenged this would definitely be a major pain point for you.\r\n\r\nOverall, still worth the purchase and giving it a shot. The story constantly kept me excited to go for more and I had a good 20+ hours of doing the extra content.",

The soundtrack is bold, fresh, and not tiring whatsoever. The environments are gorgeous and imaginative.\n\nOf course, every RPG needs a good story, and this game delivers in ways that I haven't seen in may games in a long while. I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say I was hooked. Once I finished the prologue, I knew this game was something special. I'm probably going to be quoting several lines from this game for a long, long time.\n\nAs for the combat: Yes, it's turn-based, but it's different than most! I found myself needing to be completely engaged when attacking and defending. Unlike in Paper Mario, the dodges and parries matter, sometimes demanding the level of precision you would need in Sekiro. Character builds have major impacts to and you are given SO MUCH to experiment with. Each character has their own style of combat, so you will need to manage how to shape each character to the needs of the team, which is especially important for the post-game content.\n\nSo I said \"mostly true,\" and you may be asking yourself \"why?\" These are mostly minor nitpicks that I can overlook, and I've seen much worse from AAA studios. The main two issues I have are around character builds: 1) they're a bit messy to manipulate, and 2) the spike in demand for increasingly better builds really only appear in the late post game content.\n\nWith all that said, I thoroughly enjoyed this game start to finish. It's a wonderful experience and I hope Sandfall keeps making wild and imaginative quality games like this.\n\nFor those who come after.",

It managed to bring back the nostalgia of old-school turn-based RPGs while modernizing the genre and taking everything to an incredibly high level: visually, technically, musically and above all, narratively. The plot keeps you on edge with constant surprises right up until the end.\n\nThey‚Äôve managed to create this small yet great gem that‚Äôs worth every cent. My absolute GOTY this year. Please, do yourself a favor and play it.\n\nI hope it can inspire future developers to create games with the same passion and care that were poured into this one.\n\n\"For those who come after.\"",

        "review": "To summarize, this game is basically a more mature Persona game in both game mechanics (additional features) and storyline.\n\nI originally bought this to spit on Ubisoft, and hearing positive comments about this game from Team Cherry and from the French President. There was a reason that tempted me to get this game in the first two months of its release, which was the soundtrack, where I only listened to \"Lumiere\" and was nearly convinced to buy the game.\n\nI actually regret not buying the game in the first two months of its release because I was in awe in the prologue and got really emotional in the end. I'm still in Act 2 at the time of typing this review, and the story is amazing as it knows when to be serious and a good time to be humorous. Right now, it's the third game that made me shed a tear, and the first to make me shed a tear multiple times.\n\nThe game mechanic is really fun; it's a turn-based strategy that awards you for precision from attacking at a perfect time or parrying all the enemy's attacks to return the damage to the sender. What I like is that, despite the game being turn-based, there are some enemies where it will never be your turn for a while, such as enemies doing four turns before yours or doing infinite turns just because you suck at parrying (this might have been me for three attempts for THAT chromatic enemy). \n\nHowever, what I have mixed thoughts on are some of the tutorials, such as the jump and gradient counter, as they never explain that enemies using those attacks meant you should be ready to parry, not to immediately parry as I did a lot in my first hour in Act 2.",

        "review": "Modern classic bruh, the narrative is very confident and u already give a gaf about it two minutes in. The events between each of the Acts are unforgettable and it's obviously best experienced blind so I'll shut up on that end. I think calling the design revolutionary or innovative is misleading, because the mechanics are instead thoroughly inspired by some of the best JRPGs in history and just smashes em all together into one of the best gameplay loops I've played thru in years, with a lot of flexibility and an emphasis on making fun kits. Expert mode is just challenging enough for somebody who is a little too busy to sit on a challenging boss for a week, but if you're looking for some souls BS or are worried it will be too easy the postgame will change your mind, especially one optional fight.\r\n\r\nMy one complaint is that although the soundtrack is probably my favorite OST ever, it's implemented a little awkwardly. I understand what they were going for with the adaptive battle/area themes and sometimes it works well, but looping the first section of a song over and over is not really how music is supposed to be structured for listening. I found the moments where I'm finally listening to AMAZING tracks like the Paintress Theme in-game and not on Spotify for the 500th time kind of disappointing. Combat music choice in general for several sections in the Act 3/postgame also felt a little repetitive, they could've picked more than the handful they did and pumped more hype into a few of the superbosses. In fact, some tracks like \"Atelier de Clea - Contre le Coeur\" that have great vocals NEVER play the vocals throughout the entire game to extent of my knowledge/research. I think it would've been a wiser choice for Sandfall to drop some of the sound engineering and let Lorien Testard's phenomenal tracks speak for themselves in a few sections.\r\n\r\nAgain though: I am only complaining about this because I have listened to the soundtrack religiously since first booting the game up several months ago... This one of the best OSTs and general sets of orchestrations ever, and it's a shame that I think it sounds best on Spotify... 10/10 experience nonetheless, I'm curious if other people feel the same about the soundtrack or if I just listened to it too much outside of the game bc I love it <3",

        "review": "As much as I would love to indulge my contrarian self, and as shameful as it is for me to praise what is essentially Persona made by the French, I must agree with the rest of the faceless goons creeping around this platform. Yes indeed, although the capacity for joy has all but left my mortal shell, Expedition 33 is all I have come to demand from a video game and more: a product of passion, not greed; brought forth by valued craftsmen, not employees; motivated by their own artistic integrity, not projected revenue. I can hardly believe this is the team's first project. Where did these people even come from? And where have they been all our lives? Doubtless, a mystery for historians to ponder.\n\nNow, my religion usually forbids me to engage in monetary transactions unless there's money to be saved, and I was resigned to the prospect of waiting a good two years or longer for a chance at a big discount. Fortunately for my wallet, however, and unfortunately for my dignity as an independent human being, I happen to be acquainted with a dumb little gremlin who's allergic to money. If by any chance you're reading this, I appreciate the gesture. Don't do it again. So anyway, here I am booting up the hot new thing, and - Notre-Dame de Paris, my room is on fire! Games aren't supposed to have so many particle effects. Why, if my computer was a woman, she would be begging me to divorce her. To little avail, of course. My enjoyment of the game is way more important than a robot wife's comfort. Which is to say, the level of detail is astounding. The environments are whimsical and dream-like, the characters are incredibly well realized and the Lumina system allows me to ruin some of the greatest boss fights ever seen with my degenerate strategies.\n\nActually, while we're on the topic of characters, I'm eternally grateful to the developers for allowing me to play as an adult man who doesn't have to rely on his government-mandated surrogate child to emote on his behalf all the time. Quite refreshing indeed, but I will be forced to deduct ten points for dear Gustave's pseudo-bionic arm, a trope which I feel has gotten just a little tired. Gee, Gustave, you're just so cool with your irrelevant disability and lack of symmetry. Can somebody tell me why every modern protagonist has to be missing an arm? Why is it always one arm? Talk trash about Human Revolution all you like, at least Jensen had the balls to go all the way. Man was missing both of those suckers and then some. And what's so special about fake arms, anyway? I see this crap in every game I play. Metal arms, wooden arms, living arms, magic arms, gun arms, sword arms, arms that explode, arms that electrocute, arms with grappling hooks, arms that vibrate your position in space-time, arms that make you coffee in the morning, arms that hold you tight and say they love you, no really, we do, we were wrong to leave you. We're happy to be your parents and we're proud of you. I'm sick of it. We have four limbs, don't we? When are we going to see Doom Guy jumping over a demon with his deployable spring legs like he's Inspector Gadget? Never, that's when, because game developers are a bunch of quacks bigger than my psychologist.\n\n...where was I? Ah, yes, presentation. Especially the part of it which pertains to sound design. Fun fact: human beings are just as emotionally responsive to sound as they are to colour, perhaps even more so the former. I considered adding a little something about olfactory memory to go with that statement, too, but decided against it. I don't think we as an industry are ready for that conversation, and besides, this game review's already too long as it is. But regardless, it's clear that Sandfall put a lot of effort and resources into making sure that the score was varied and the actors had clear and proper direction. In fact, even more so than the writing or the art direction, by themselves already miles above the standard fare, I'd go so far as to cite the voice acting as the primary reason behind this game's success. I cannot in all honesty recall the last time I experienced such consistently life-like performances across an entire cast (in a feature-length RPG, no less!), but I could absolutely come up with a list of the past one hundred times I ended up rolling my eyes at badly written and delivered dialogue in an otherwise perfectly serviceable story. Which is strange, isn't it? It's almost as if having the characters talk it out like real people directly correlates to stronger audience engagement and therefore bigger returns on your investment. Yet it's nearly always a footnote in the development process, and I just don't seem to know why.\n\nBut I do know what I want: I want better music and dialogue in video games. I want to see the clashing of different ideologies. I want to care about the characters and their stuggles, I want to feel sad when they're sad and feel mad when they're mad. I want empathy, because feeling is what separates art from entertainment, and I've no money to spare for toys. I want more Clair Obscur. And less robot arms.\n\n",

The choice you make at the end of the game is exactly what makes Clair Obscur 33 a good piece of art. This game delivers an emotional journey and interactions with characters that make you feel the weight of your decision. There are no good or bad guys‚Äîthere is just being human and how you deal with loss. In addition to the themes of loss, the game explores a few other thought-provoking themes. Aside from the beautiful story, the music, visuals, and combat in this game are outstanding.\n\nThis game is and will be a real powerful memory in my neural networks. Well done Sandfall!",

There is so much to do beside the main objective, and a lot of it is way too hard to do at your current level, so you can easily get overwhelmed by insane side mobs that one shot you.

I'm not going to lie when I say I had ZERO interest in Expedition 33, my uncle showed it to me initially and it looked a bit cool. But still I wasn't interested.\r\n\r\nUntil one day, I had received a gift on May 9th from my uncle. I decided, why not, it doesn't hurt to play it for a little bit. At first, the intro to the game was a bit confusing to me and didn't really make sense. This gave me a purpose to continue playing. I played more and more, and I just couldn't stop until I got all the achievements, beat the game, and finish the side stories. \r\n\r\nBut even with finishing nearly everything the game had to offer, I then started a NG+ run to feel the story again. To see the foreshadowing that I missed out before, run around the environments to collect things. The gameplay is immensely satisfying to me, along with the beautiful music, and the raw and natural story. All this sparked my interest in gaming again. I strive to find an original concept like this game again in the future.\r\n\r\nAll in all, this game is Whoooo, but also Wheeee! So the Wheeee balances the Whoooo.\r\n\r\nFor those who come after,\r\nTomorrow comes.\r\n\r\nP.S. To my uncle. Thank you for gifting me this game. If you didn't, I would have never played it and I would have missed out on this life changing experience. \"Learn from those who came before, and lay the trail for those who come after.\"",

Game runs smoothly but considering you are pretty much just going in a beautiful space with minimal interaction I expect smooth running is not a problem as there is nothing thats going on in the background. So beatuiful art, bad gameplay I bought it to due to so many positive comments and i didnt refund to support the developers as they are on to something.",

        "review": "I have so many feelings about this game: love, passion, heartbreak, frustration... Essentially, I admire Expedition 33 deeply as a work of art, but have mixed feelings on some of the gameplay. I've written a short essay.\n\nThe Impeccable:\n\n--Story: One of the most well written, complex, emotional stories I have ever experienced. I cried in the prologue and sobbed uncontrollably in the epilogue. The characters were so real and complicated, the worldbuilding was unique and engrossing, and the plot twisted at every turn and kept me glued to the screen through every cutscene. This game deserves an arsenal of Emmys for the cinematography and acting. Truly a masterpiece.\n\n--Art: The primary theme of this game is art, and the art of the game itself did not disappoint. I loved exploring the wildly illustrated world, seeing what new and twisted enemy would come on the screen next, and took so many screenshots I could make an art book of them. The human characters were beautifully animated and so realistic in their expressions and speaking.\n\n--Music: Gorgeous. Emotional. Diverse. Just wow. The score of this game ranged from hauntingly beautiful vocals to screamo punk to classical piano to grooving funk, and yet all of it somehow, incomprehensibly, blended together and formed a single aesthetic consistent with the game.\n\n--Character Builds: I loved the system of weapons, skills, pictos/luminas, and stat points. Each character had an entirely unique and fascinating system of fighting, but within each preset build, you had so much agency to customize their specializations. It was a lot to learn, but I really enjoyed it once I understood it and have never seen anything like the builds E33 presented.\n\nThe Mixed:\n\n--Fighting: I did enjoy the mix of turn-based and real-time block/parry/counterattack. It was engaging and worked seamlessly in battles. I really enjoyed the longer boss fights where I could master the timings of all the different attacks and build up skills throughout the fight to stack bigger and bigger damage payoffs.\n\nHowever - early game fights were super repetitive and tedious. I felt like I ran into an enemy every other step and had to start the same fight over and over again with limited skills that bored me. It was fun that every new type of enemy had new attacks to learn, but all the side fights just felt like a grind. This did improve throughout the game somewhat as skills became more complex, but I still got bored by the repetition.\n\nThe Not Great:\n\n--Pacing: Despite 8 months of anticipation for this game and my overflowing enthusiasm when I first started it, I almost quit multiple times in the first 10 hours. That's how long it took me to recruit all Act 1 characters: 10 hours. The start of this game was just SO slow. I appreciate that each character had unique fighting styles to learn, but really Sandfall, we're a bit smarter than you give us credit for. I was so bored during the early levels, and the builds took a long time to gain power and complexity. Once I got to Act II, the pacing picked up significantly, but then slowed again in Act III.\n\n--Lack of Structure: I spent so much time in Act I wandering around, getting lost, and not knowing where to go next. The lack of maps within regions drove me absolutely insane, and the single listed quest at any given time was essentially \"keep playing the game.\" I'm sure some people enjoyed the 'explore and find out for yourself' style of this game, but I would have appreciated just a 'bit' more direction via maps and objectives. Once again, Act II was much better than Act I in this regard, but then Act III went back to the 'figure it out for yourself' model. I don't know how I would have gotten through Act III without online guides telling me where new areas were and which ones I could handle at what level.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo - would I recommend this game? Yes. I can't stop thinking about it. I think E33 deserves its accolades for being a cinematic masterpiece, for its unique builds/fighting, and for its origins in a humble French developer who sold millions of copies in the first few months. I do think the game could be improved in many ways, and it wasn't the greatest gameplay experience I've ever had. The inconsistent pacing and lack of structure frustrated me to no end. But overall I was deeply affected by this game, and I think that deserves a lot of credit.",

        "review": "Simply put, this is one of the best pieces of fictional media ever made, and it just so happens to be in video game form. The story is incredible, the visuals are stunning, and the music is absolutely breath-taking. I think this may very well have the best intro to any game ever created, guaranteed to hook you in the first half hour. All the different elements of this game mix and mash perfectly and compliment each other so well.\n\nThe combat is the only thing about this game I think you might find subjective. It is a turn based system, but it is a very active turn based system. There is very much a \"get good\" factor with this game as far as parrying and dodging goes especially if you choose to play on the higher difficulties as the windows to pull off these mechanics are extremely tight. \n\nGraphically it's not perfect. There are moments where characters hands/objects they are holding clip through clothing or environment, but none of these moments are egregious in my opinion. That being said it's probably the only downside to this game graphically as the environments, skills, characters, cutscenes, and effects are gorgeous.\n\nCharacters are relatable and behave like real people. The writing done for this game was immaculate.\n\nMusically this game has something for just about everybody. The soundtrack for this game is so diverse you are bound to find a track that you can really vibe with. I think that this games soundtrack will comfortably sit among the greatest OST's of all time. \n\nAll things considered, this very well may be the best game I have ever played and it easily sits in my top 10 favorite games of all time, maybe even top 5. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is to gaming what The Godfather is to movies, an absolute masterpiece, and a clear reminder that when done correctly creating a video game can be a beautiful work of art. Worst part about this game is that I'll never be able to experience it for the first time again. Would recommend this game to literally anybody",

On the overworld, areas above your level show a reddish entrance, so you put a mental pin in them (in-game pins don't exist, which, really, is a ... stupid oversight, sorry). Then, once appropriately level, they lose their reddish cast. But once that later period comes, where have you and haven't been?\n\nAs I usually find cons, alone, in game reviews unhelpful, I'd recommend making a little note on your phone of what locations you've visited--along with the specific locations of yet-too-tough bosses on the overworld (again, map pins not existing), because I misplaced said bosses far too often.",

Then it TURNED out it's a turn-based RPG. I'm not a big fan of that, really. But after I saw the reception, I decided to give it a try. It was one of my best decisions this year. This game and Marvel Midnight Suns showed me that turn-based RPGs definitely worth a try.\nIt's hard to describe how good this game is. This is the first game I played twice in a row and still had fun. Visuals, story and atmosphere are great. The soundtrack is something out of this world. \nI don't know what else to say to make someone play this game. Just buy it and play, I hope you won't regret. I didn't.",

        "review": "Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 completely blew me out of the water. The world is jaw-dropping in every scene, and the combat feels absolutely amazing. I was a bit skeptical at first, because I don't really like turn-based games, but the parry mechanic makes everything feel so fluid and like so much fun, its extremely satisfying. The soundtrack? Absolutely insane; it varies from sad piano, absolutely amazing vocals from Alice, and great boss themes that still live in my head and still listen to almost daily. I came in as a massive Hollow Knight/Silksong fan‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm putting this above them, even when Silksong was an absolute 10/10 for me as well. That‚Äôs how special this game is; it's a piece of art with a dev team that has put so much love and passion into this game. You don't get these type of games often, so I hope this is a sign to all game developers that you dont need big names and multi-billion dollar companies to make a great game; just pure love, passion and talented people. Both Expedition and Silksong are great examples.\n\nWhat really surprised me the most is how much heart there is in the story. It‚Äôs dark, emotional, and every chapter pulled me in even deeper. The voice acting is phenomenal, some of the best I‚Äôve ever heard, that really brings the characters to life and make the emotional scenes hit really hard, especially the voice actors of Maelle, Verso and Gustave, but I also really love Renoir's and Lune's. This isn‚Äôt just a short RPG either; it‚Äôs packed with sooo much content. The main story itself is already filled with content, but now that I completed that part, there is still so much to explore with hidden bosses and weapons, and all the ways you can experiment with skills and builds.\n\nThis is one of those rare games that comes along and completely raises the bar. For me, it‚Äôs not just a great game, not just the best game of this year, but it might even be my favorite game of all time. I know that recency bias exists, so I also don't want to be too definitive about this statement, but I also don't want to take away any credits from this game that it absolutely deserves.",

In my opinion, delayed attacks are a cheap design and just \"inflates\" the difficulty. Oh, here comes this mob with a steel chair. Wait, he's winding up. Hold on, don't parry yet...wait...just a little bit-\n\nAND HE HITS YOU WITH A DROP KICK INSTEAD\n\nThe terrible performance also makes the delayed attacks worse. I pressed parry button, BUT fps dropped so frozen eveque just one tap my team instead. Bravo!\n\nAlso the parkour/volleyball games suck. Delayed attacks and stiffy animations, not to mention to egregious zoomed out screen making the gestrals hard to spot and destroy the raft.\n\n",

Everything else about this experience is absolutely worth it to dive in for.\n\nThat this game came from a rather inexperienced first-timer team, and the writing in particular from a writer who has no published works beforehand, and mostly just wrote for herself is... \nThey deserve every award they will receive.\n\nThere are some issues, though, that shouldn't be ignored:\n- Why, oh why, is there no \"repeat battle\" button? Instead, you have to wait until enemies finish you off if you want to restart a battle. Utter waste of time.\n\n- Why, when you repeat a battle, does the cinematic before the battle repeat as well? Sure, you can skip that, but why even repeat it in the first place? Waste of time, again.\n\n- Some bosses have multiple phases, which is nice. But why is there no checkpoint in-between them? In all cases, a boss's first phase is drastically easier than the second and once you are able to get to the second phase, you won't struggle with the first anymore. This lack of a checkpoint here is, again, a waste of time.\n\n- There is great depth to the combat system in theory. All the effects, synergies and the ways the characters interact with each other. It could be great, if it weren't for one thing: Even min-maxing doesn't do a whole lot of difference if you don't master the parrying (on Hard+). And if you do master the parrying, it is really all you need and you can ignore all the other systems.\nThose two parts of the combat are at odds with each other design-wise, with the real-time parts making all the rest almost entirely superficial.\nThe combat would have been better with a more traditional turn-based system as well as with a more traditional real-time system.\n\n- Some of the encounters feel more like \"gotcha!\"s that were made annoying on purpose to mess with the player. Not a fan of design like that.",

After half a year now I finally decided to give it a try, and I think the biggest praise I can give it in one sentence is this: At least for me, It lives up to all the praise and then some.\nI don't want to discuss this game in too much detail here as to not spoil things, but I will say some general things still, since I cannot help myself but praise the game now that I've seen basically all it has to offer. The presentation and artstyle are just absolutely beautiful, the music and overall story are genuinely close to if not on par with Nier Automata, which for me still is probably the pinnacle of this medium in these two regards, and on top of all of this it somehow is also probably my favourite turn based rpg in terms of its actual gameplay, and this cannot be understated. Like this game, a turn based rpg, which I wouldn't really say is my favourite genre of games generally, reached the same heights with at least some of its fights (my favourite being a very late game optional boss) for me that fighting, learning and overcoming a really good hard fight in something like Elden Ring, Dark Souls 3 or Sekiro reached. That is not at ALL something I was expecting to get out of a turn based rpg, let alone one made by a pretty small team.\nSo yea, honestly, huge respect and praise to the devs. This joins the collection of games I would point to as a counterargument whenever anyone tries to argue that games are not art. If you are even remotely interested in this game, go get it and play it when you are able to, it really is one of THOSE games that you really owe it to yourself to experience. And so another entry into my all time favourites has been made, side by side with Hollow Knight: Silksong. This really is one hell of year.",

        "review": "An excellent rpg that serves as a French interpretation of the modern Final Fantasy series, with elements of Super Mario RPG or Legend of Dragoon and Chrono Trigger. While most of the story beats are similar enough to those inspirations to lack any real surprise element, the presentation is excellent enough to place it on par with the best of them. Overall, this is essentially the kind of game fans of Final Fantasy have been wanting from a Final Fantasy ever since X, which we sadly never got; hopefully this quells any of the misguided assumptions that these kinds of games can't be successful in the modern era. Looking forward to a sequel, for what will come after, I would highly suggest.",

        "review": "To say that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 might be one of my personal favourite games of the past few years would be an understatement. In an era where Game Design has become Corporate and Stale, only following whatever is currently popular, Expedition 33 dared not only to follow its own path, but also to provide one of the most Enthralling and Immersive Stories of the past Decade. The World feels real. The Story, once it grips you, never lets go until that final Line, and The Characters are as fleshed out as some of the best Protagonists in Gaming. \n\nThis isn't even talking about the Gameplay, which is arguably, the most important aspect of any Game. It's rare I find the combat in a JRPG as engaging as this. Challenging but rewarding, Combat never once became stale. With so much depth underneath the Surface, yet not once does it fall into the usual Trap of becoming too complicated to Build Characters in a specific way. \n\nMy biggest Gripe outside of some Minor Nitpicks is the Performance. Unreal Engine 5 is of infamous at this point for its issues. In Truth, it feels kind of unfair to bring this up, as this is mostly out of the Hands of Developers and the Fault entirely lies on Epic for this. I do not believe that a Game like this could exist on any other Engine, and truthfully, it is hardly the worst optimisation I've seen in a game of this scale, hence Why I can still recommend it. I just ask that people double check their Hardware before buying as to avoid disappointment. But even then, a game of this scale for around ¬£40? (roughly $50 USD) is hard to say no to. \n\nEven if you're not a fan of JRPGs, I can safely say, you'll hardly be disappointed here. Just give it a Chance.",

When it came onto my radar I waived it off because I've never been too big a fan of the JRPG style turn-based combat. But after I kept hearing about it, I decided to pick it up to check it out. And I am glad to say that Expedition 33 deserves every single compliment it receives. \r\nDespite of my usual dislike of this style of game, I enjoyed every second of playing this one. The story is incredibly interesting and compelling, the characters are likable and well-written, the soundtrack is consistently great, and the gameplay is innovative and expansive. I don't want to say too much more and risk spoiling anything, but if you are reading this review, you should absolutely get the game, You're practically guaranteed to enjoy it.",

The combat system is simple yet fun with engaging parry/dodge mechanics added. It doesn't artificially limit you from making powerful builds and eventually breaking the game. Uses hub world navigation similar to older FF games. The graphics are unique but very well done and immersive -- and it's a rarity for UE5 games to run well these days but it does. The best part of the game easily is the music, sound work, and story. The good gameplay is just a hook for exploring these.",

Throughout the game, you keep getting presented with question after question, and most of them were answered by the end with a satisfying pay off. Some of them stay as mysteries, or are only answered if you explore more. Characters are well-written, not one-dimensional. Perfect balance of dark and somber themes with wholesome and light-hearted moments.",

        "review": "By now, I doubt there is much I could add to the praise this game has gotten.  \r\n\r\nIs it perfect?  No... But it is damn close.  \r\n\r\nThe story, the settings, the characters, and soundtrack are all incredible and, despite the heavy story content, so much fun.  The second \"level\" had me panning the camera around just to look at all the neat things that were happening.  \r\nThe acting in the story scenes was particularly good.  The mo-cap and finished animations giving each character subtle movements and telling glances.  So much of the subtext and feelings of each character are done with the eyes in a way that I have not seen in a video game of this scale.  It really was like watching a movie.\r\nThe story itself is dark and unique and doesn't answer all the questions it asks, but it does so in a way that feel natural and \"real\".  It is a story about grief and loss and dealing with that, but its not as overly moody as some indie games can be.  \r\n\r\nThe game-play itself and the mechanics is where it starts to show a little bit. \r\nPersonally I like feeling like I am playing a god by the end of a good RPG, and here... well it felt that way a little too soon.  If you do as much as you can, as early as you can, leaving the final boss for the end, that fight is a pretty short... and thats how most fights are.   If you are under leveled, you get trounced unless you have the parry/dodge thing down.  if you are at the right level (which you will be for most of the game), they are fun, with a fair difficulty.  But if you are slightly over-leved, like the big monster in the sea wrecked you the first time, so you played a bunch of story and side quests, gained levels and went \"Oh yeah, I should try that again...\" He's a push over.  The \"9999\" damage number that was so saught after in the Final Fantasy days comes quick here.  Does it ruin the game?  Not at all! But it does take some of the challenge away if you leave some fights to long.  At the same time, there are a couple of fights that I haven't finished yet because I am not strong enough!\r\n\r\nThe other gripe I had was the camera at times, and how it works in battles.  You get a fairy large character to play and he sometimes blocks his own menus.... I had the camera duck behind tall grasses to get the right angle on an enemies attack, and totally block it from view... hard to parry that...  But again, It wasnt game breaking, but it does keep this game from getting that \"PERFECT\" rating.\r\n\r\nIn the end, this is a game that needs to be played.  Even with the warts and flaws, thi sis an achievment worth celebrating.  If you like story rich games, RPGs, deep stories, and enjoyable characters... play this game!",

        "review": "It's been a few years since I‚Äôve felt compelled to write a game review, but I felt the need to do so after Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 became one of my favorite video games of all time. My only regret in playing this game is that it may have actually ruined video games for me because of how much better it is compared to most other games. \n\nI‚Äôm just echoing most players when I praise the story, the music, and the hybrid turn-based/real-time gameplay. As a fan of FF10‚Äôs gameplay, Expedition 33 scratched that itch that studios don‚Äôt release too often anymore. I adored the turn-based combat system while mixing in real-time mechanics for dodging/parrying. The timing for the parrying system can be challenging at first, but you‚Äôll get the hang of it in time and the game rewards you for mastering this skill. As for the music, just spend a couple minutes on the main menu screen and you‚Äôll understand. What surprised me was how many musical genres were present in this game and how well it all worked together. And then there‚Äôs the story. I can count on one hand how many story narratives (whether it was a movie, a video game, a book, etc.) that actually moved me to tears. Expedition 33 is one of them. There‚Äôs a lot I could discuss here, but I‚Äôll just mention this: I love how Expedition 33 manages to create plenty of light and comedic moments in an otherwise dark and bleak world. One of my pet peeves in JRPGs is the overuse of fantasy races that primarily serve as comic relief (such as the Nopon from the Xenoblade series). The Gestrals, however, provide hilarious moments without being too out-of-place with the added bonus that their humor actually contributes to the narrative in a meaningful way.\n\nI do have a couple critiques for the game though. The first one being menu navigation when accessing pictos, skills, etc. It can certainly feel a bit clunky especially when you‚Äôre in the late game and you have so many pictos to select from. As for gameplay, it can be quite easy to be overleveled for the final boss which results in the player just demolishing this fight, but a quick fix for this would be to unequip the ability that removes your 9999-damage cap. For the most part, these issues didn‚Äôt really bother me too much.\n\nAfter 69 hours of playing Expedition 33, I can safely say that this game holds a special place in my heart, and I won‚Äôt soon forget it. In time, I will give this game another playthrough in NG+ and try to pick up on all the foreshadowing that I missed throughout my first playthrough. What an incredible debut from Sandfall Interactive and I look forward to seeing what they develop next!",

From the angelic sound-track, breathtaking world-design, well-written story, and real-time turn-based combat; all handcrafted with insane amounts of passion behind it. The game didn't require any artificial hype pushing it to succeed, it was naturally generated from simply doing the right things, and Sandfall caring about they put out. What kind of developers release FREE additional late-game content to a fully finished game that's already sold over 5 million copies?? Ones that [b] love [/b] their game and the community they built, power to good studios. \n\nPlaying through the game to its fullest completion, im left stunned at how an unknown studio was able to produce such a masterpiece in an already dominated genre. I would be [b] UTTERLY [/b] surprised if they aren't a Game of the Year nominee.",

I even shed a tear at the end.\n Beautiful visuals, beautiful locations, well-designed characters with lively emotions, and unique enemy designs.\n The music is memorable and evokes emotions. It's expressive and diverse. I bought the soundtrack, and my mom asked me what kind of music it was (even though she's not interested in games). Amazing voice acting of the characters, unusually lively, in the characters you BELIEVE.\nGameplay. Unusual. A plus to the game for the ability to take out enemies before they have time to do something, I parry and dodge very poorly. It's cool that the gameplay for each character is unique. Skins are cute.\n\n Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is my nominee for the game of the year. Yes, a lot of goodies came out, but a lot or sequels or games straight from famous studios. And here we have an original setting and original gameplay.",

Perfectly serviceable, but can overwhelm the rest of the experience on harder tuned fights.\r\n\r\nWhere this game really shines is everywhere else; the story, the music, the atmosphere and writing, characters and humour, every bit of this world draws you in and makes you want to stay, even when you know you shouldn't.\r\n\r\nA must play.",

I only play on the second easiest difficulty cause im new but its still challenging but all i can say is dont give up before you truly understand the upgrades and upgrade paths. Im VERY slow when it comes to it and it took me until ACT 2 to understand pictos and luminas. But it made the game 100x easier",

But, I was pleasantly surprised. \r\nI will be shocked if this doesn't win game of the year. \r\nThe only thing I didn't think was necessary or enjoyable was having to wear a new pictos for 4 fights to unlock it for other characters (basically just had to go run off and get into combat with four easy fights and get it learned super quick anyways only taking about a minute). \r\nBut, since that minor complaint is only a tiny inconvenience, it is easy to overlook and enjoy the rest of it. \r\nDon't look up anything about the game otherwise you will spoil/ruin a lot of the game for yourself. \r\nThe music, combat, and story are all enjoyable.",

The story is great and rewards those who pay close attention along the way, as it gives away what's happening to those that are invested. Great story telling and lore design.\r\n\r\nThere are bugs, but they don't detract from the overall experience.",

        "review": "It's a real masterpiece!\nThe storytelling is very innovative, and it really changes the game progression. The break of expectations and plot twists are insane! What you think the game is initially, it's not, and then you have a whole new game on the same game, as the acts progress. It's as a new layer is added to the game every new act.  That's as much as I can say without giving any spoilers.\nThe story is heavy and dense and like no game I've ever seen before. \nOf course, the whole soundtrack is another masterpiece by itself, but elevates the game experience so much!\nThe mechanics are not exactly new, but are updated and modernized, making it very fluid. It's not perfect. I think the battle system is too dependant on the parry, which for me is a flaw. But that's totally a personal opinion, I know some people will find it great.",

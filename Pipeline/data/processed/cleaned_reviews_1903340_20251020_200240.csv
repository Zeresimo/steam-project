1903340,it's been a few years since ive felt compelled to write a game review but i felt the need to do so after clair obscur expedition 33 became one of my favorite video games of all time my only regret in playing this game is that it may have actually ruined video games for me because of how much better it is compared to most other games im just echoing most players when i praise the story the music and the hybrid turnbasedrealtime gameplay as a fan of ff10s gameplay expedition 33 scratched that itch that studios dont release too often anymore i adored the turnbased combat system while mixing in realtime mechanics for dodgingparrying the timing for the parrying system can be challenging at first but youll get the hang of it in time and the game rewards you for mastering this skill as for the music just spend a couple minutes on the main menu screen and youll understand what surprised me was how many musical genres were present in this game and how well it all worked together and then theres the story i can count on one hand how many story narratives whether it was a movie a video game a book etc that actually moved me to tears expedition 33 is one of them theres a lot i could discuss here but ill just mention this i love how expedition 33 manages to create plenty of light and comedic moments in an otherwise dark and bleak world one of my pet peeves in jrpgs is the overuse of fantasy races that primarily serve as comic relief such as the nopon from the xenoblade series the gestrals however provide hilarious moments without being too outofplace with the added bonus that their humor actually contributes to the narrative in a meaningful way i do have a couple critiques for the game though the first one being menu navigation when accessing pictos skills etc it can certainly feel a bit clunky especially when youre in the late game and you have so many pictos to select from as for gameplay it can be quite easy to be overleveled for the final boss which results in the player just demolishing this fight but a quick fix for this would be to unequip the ability that removes your 9999damage cap for the most part these issues didnt really bother me too much after 69 hours of playing expedition 33 i can safely say that this game holds a special place in my heart and i wont soon forget it in time i will give this game another playthrough in ng and try to pick up on all the foreshadowing that i missed throughout my first playthrough what an incredible debut from sandfall interactive and i look forward to seeing what they develop next,True,1760824292,4146,1

1903340,why are you looking at this review buy the game this is an amazing team of developers who were clearly crushed at ubisoft who made such a beautiful game if you concern is that its turn based combat don't worry unlike other turn based games you can still do stuff on the enemies turn its not a case of wait 10 minutes to be able to do anything again,True,1760810762,2412,27

1903340,the 15 hours i spent in this game on steam made an impression on me to reward the devs i purchased this on ps5 as well i have no issue buying twice to do my part so sandfall interactive understands i appreciate their hard work graphics on pc are way better but i have 25 hours on my ps5 and i intend to replay it on steam as well amazing game and i will not deduct marks even though i wanted to smash my controller a few times due to the gestral beach mini game,True,1760806797,99,12

1903340,a great story that evoked a storm of emotions it's been a long time since i've been so blown away by a plot twist i even shed a tear at the end beautiful visuals beautiful locations welldesigned characters with lively emotions and unique enemy designs the music is memorable and evokes emotions it's expressive and diverse i bought the soundtrack and my mom asked me what kind of music it was even though she's not interested in games amazing voice acting of the characters unusually lively in the characters you believe gameplay unusual a plus to the game for the ability to take out enemies before they have time to do something i parry and dodge very poorly it's cool that the gameplay for each character is unique skins are cute clair obscur expedition 33 is my nominee for the game of the year yes a lot of goodies came out but a lot or sequels or games straight from famous studios and here we have an original setting and original gameplay,True,1760803238,4863,4
1903340,banger,True,1760801507,1638,12
1903340,great game dragged down by its horrible parrying mechanic and i do genuinely mean the worst possible way to ever implement parrying in a turn based game where your success is bound to parrying attacks most the time you dont even know when to parry unless youve seen the attack before or you got lucky the music didnt cover the sometimes existing sound cue the story is great and the highlight of the game with twists youd never expect intriguing fun etc genuinely the only negative i have with the game is the parrying being a requirement,True,1760800275,2326,86

1903340,an rpg that demands your attention from the very first moments and delivers the same quality of gripping storytelling and emotions every moment through many have praised the gameplay but honestly it's pretty typical jrpg fare with a heavyhanded focus on the timed parry mechanic perfectly serviceable but can overwhelm the rest of the experience on harder tuned fights where this game really shines is everywhere else the story the music the atmosphere and writing characters and humour every bit of this world draws you in and makes you want to stay even when you know you shouldn't a must play,True,1760788202,5571,16

1903340,honestly one of the most engaging and games i have ever played at first i genuinely thought of refunding the game after the first few minutes because i thought that it wasn't a game i would enjoy knowing it was turn based but after the prologue i was hooked and ended up playing for nearly 11 hours straight without realizing it it has one of my favorite soundtracks in gaming now having beat the game i can't comprehend how i thought of refunding such a masterpiece of a gaming experience,True,1760772243,3981,2

1903340,cinema,True,1760767496,3349,15
1903340,one of the best movies i've ever seen featuring one of the best soundtracks i've ever heard yet it manages to unapologetically remind you that it's a video game in the most wild of ways all wrapped within a resonating lesson on the nature of what it is to be alive this was a unique experience that i don't anticipate being rivaled for a very long time this is a game made by gamers for gamers thank you sandfall interactive,True,1760766321,9284,4
1903340,absolute masterpiece everything is almost flawless the only thing that's little annoying is that some cutscenes look little pixelated but that's where cons end and of course we can't forget about soundtracks they are literally perfect and are amazingly composed this game is overall a mustplay even if you don't like turn based games i also don't really like turn based games but e33 made the combat system soo good because you will change your mind,True,1760765912,329,7

1903340,perfect game soundtrack character development and visuals it's very deserving of game of the year imo only complaint is the dumb volleyball mini game mechanics that game makes me wanna pull my hair out with how bad the hit reg was working and god forbid you use a controller with a millimeter of stick drift because your character will not move or look the right way 99910 game,True,1760765344,1451,3

1903340,it's good like really good i was initially turned off by the fact that it was going to be turn based combat in a final fantasy style type of combat system but i was pleasantly surprised i will be shocked if this doesn't win game of the year the only thing i didn't think was necessary or enjoyable was having to wear a new pictos for 4 fights to unlock it for other characters basically just had to go run off and get into combat with four easy fights and get it learned super quick anyways only taking about a minute but since that minor complaint is only a tiny inconvenience it is easy to overlook and enjoy the rest of it don't look up anything about the game otherwise you will spoilruin a lot of the game for yourself the music combat and story are all enjoyable,True,1760764881,4673,23
1903340,great game especially for a smaller studio,True,1760764405,8803,14
1903340,absolute masterpiece every aspect deserves its praise the big stand out was there is over 8 hours of music yet there is no throw away songs every song is good the story is great and rewards those who pay close attention along the way as it gives away what's happening to those that are invested great story telling and lore design there are bugs but they don't detract from the overall experience,True,1760760928,4835,1
1903340,it's a real masterpiece the storytelling is very innovative and it really changes the game progression the break of expectations and plot twists are insane what you think the game is initially it's not and then you have a whole new game on the same game as the acts progress it's as a new layer is added to the game every new act that's as much as i can say without giving any spoilers the story is heavy and dense and like no game i've ever seen before of course the whole soundtrack is another masterpiece by itself but elevates the game experience so much the mechanics are not exactly new but are updated and modernized making it very fluid it's not perfect i think the battle system is too dependant on the parry which for me is a flaw but that's totally a personal opinion i know some people will find it great,True,1760759525,3749,11

1903340,best game released in the last 10 years absolutely goated insane ost brilliant story 1010,True,1760748251,2557,4
1903340,i will start this off by saying from a cinematic and artistic standpoint this game is a masterpiece it is beautiful has fantastic audio and music however from a turnbased and gameplay pointofview absolutely atrocious and i will gladly die on this hill and say that many of the fights in this game are just awful and terribly designed and nothing can be said to change my mind and before anyone wants to say skill issue i have done plenty of the harder fights like the chromatic enemy variants with taking either zero damage or minimal damage with the use of parrying and even winning fights with my last character purely by parrying so my criticism is fully justified and if you don't like it go cry about it to someone else anyway moving on you have so many attacks that cannot possible see coming either due to how much the camera moves and the amount of flashy effects on screen that you will get hit by a lot of the attacks as you are simply incapable of seeing the attack coming to time your dodges and parries properly speaking on not being able to see there are many times i have failed a qte for my attacks because the weapon effects are so flashy that it makes it impossible to see the arrow so i ended up switching the qte to auto complete so i'm not wasting ap for my bigger attacks that require me to not miss the qte let's talk a bit more about parrying the only way i have managed to time my parrying properly is a small audio queue that occurs right before the enemy is about to attack one of your characters without that audio queue i would fail to parry every single time because of how hard it is to parry in this game with visual queues alone however that is not without it's own issues you have to press parry the very second you hear that sound or you risk getting hit now imagine having to maintain that level of focus for enemies that attack you 59 times in a row the sheer amount of focus this game requires you to maintain during fights is unbelievably exhausting and some fights you have to deal with so many attacks that is honestly sucks the enjoyment out of the game when you're spending more time fighting the game and it's mechanics than actually enjoying the cinematic boss fight this game has more than enough identity to stand on it's own two feet without the senseless level of depth to the turnbased combat they could have simply removed parrying dodging and all of that other nonsense and this game would have done perfectly fine without them there is enough depth to the combat without the need to parry dodge and jump and no i am not going to tank my way through fights i have seen the runs of people doing that and some fights are so purely based on having good luck that it makes me question how you could even play this game without parrying or dodging my recommendation just play on the lower difficulties do not attempt to play this on expert like i have done i will finish my playthrough on expert but i will absolutely not be doing another playthrough,False,1760747899,1221,31
1903340,expedition 33 is a masterpiece there are very few games id call perfect this is one of them from start to finish it delivered everything i could hope for breathtaking art beautifully crafted character designs a compelling story great gameplay and dont even get me started on the music the soundtrack is nothing short of angelic in an era dominated by corporate greed and soulless game studios expedition 33 stands out as a labor of love it exceeds expectations in every way and reminds us what games can truly be i cant stress this enough its worth every dollar every minute and every ounce of support this game deserves to win game of the year to sandfall interactive thank you youve created something unforgettable,True,1760747273,2148,4

1903340,phenomenal presentation with tedious gameplay the good the game is incredibly beautiful with god level music easily the best soundtrack in a very long time the story is great with intriguing worldbuilding and presented in a wonderful way with deep characters and all around amazing performance by the cast the bad but this is not a movie it's a video game and the gameplay is simply mediocre the turn based combat is decent enough but it is completely invalidated by the parry system once you recognise the attack patterns there is no point in coming up with nice strategies and at high difficulty the strategies don't matter anyway unless you parry almost all attacks correctly and besides watching cutscenes and fighting there is nothing else to do the ugly and on top of that this a ue5 slop that is a stuttery mess on a 7800x3d and 7900xtx that crashes at the most inoppurtunate times despite all this the soundtrack and the beautiful world is worth enduing the tedious gameplay loop,True,1760730390,364,10

1903340,i shouldn't write a review of the game right now as having just finished it i am so frazzled if you want a tldr on this game i litterally cannot give one while talking about the game specifically all i can say is 1 if you have enjoyed any turn based combat game i 100 guarantee you will love the gameplay of this game and 2 if you love very sincere stories with dark themes this is also the game for you either one of those criteria makes this game worth it i expect 90 of this review to be about the games story i also expect 100 of this to be poorly written and all over the place as i try and write down my feeling towards this game while they are all still fresh let's start with basic observations and thoughts in regards to what i love about this game this game is without a shadow of doubt the best turn based combat system i've ever played period it isn't even close i love litterally everything about this games combat system it's unbeleivable this is the only game i've ever played and i've played a lot of games whose combat feels like it was litterally made for me each character having a unique power and skill tree amazing adding real time dodging and parrying amazing the best thing ever one of my fav games ever is sekiro so litterally my dream come true enemies are so amazingly varied in design and moveset and animations i'm litterally speachless on how much i love combat unbeleivable i love the world its absolutely stunning this game farms screenshots like no other every second feels ripped out of a painting and visuals aside i love love love the approach the game takes to exploring the world i'm a massive final fantasy fanboy so seeing this game implement that same iconic progression in exploration old school ff games had made me sooooo soo so happy also i felt the game was really well paced in terms of combat balancing spoilers for how many acts are in the game but while i felt a little op coming out of act 2 act 3's comabt was great difficulty wise ok enough about that i need to talk about 2 things story and characters i'll start with characters cause thats much easier to talk about i'm eh about them their no bg3 party but also perfectly servicable in terms of depth for rpg party members a couple things that i do think are pretty bad tho 1 is the face mocap it was really bad characters frequently had what felt like 1 expression and scenes where the devs clearly wanted you to interpet how a character feels from their face don't work cause the mocap sucks lucky thats saved by the phenominal va work i played in english and maelle stole the show shes played by shadowheart from bg3 and holy she can act incredible voice work lastly on characters the game has a very very soft relationship system it's pretty much persona social links but u rankup at night in ur camp i about 75 of the time really didnt like these conversations they felt like a waste of time it felt like the devs wanted to do persona but didnt understand how persona engages people in these types of cutscenes speaking of persona time to talk about the story ok so to start i'm gonna compare this game with metaphor real quick no spoilers for that game in my opinion metaphor is excels where this game falters and falters where this game excels eg i dont love metaphors comabt system i adore this games comabt system i adore metaphors story and characters i'm neutral on this game's character and feel really annoyedaggravateddepressedsaddened by this games story i'll try keep this as spoiler free as possible but it's very hard to so just to be safe don't read this is you havent finished the game go play it please its seriously a great game ok so this games i feel has 2 stories 1 a lot more interesting than the other 1 story the one the game starts on takes up about 90 of your playtime with the game this story is interesting and engaing until the start of act 2 where for me it felt like it got less and less interesting a part of me wants to say this is intentional and the developers thought that falling interest in story 1 would be supplimented by growing interest in story 2 which is what the game spends that last 10 of it's runtime on however i think the game does a horrible job at setting up and getting players interested in this other story it does something i hate in a story which is when you set it up with mysterious characters who only say gobbldigook at the player until their time comes to give a massive exposition dump which btw happens so much later than the intitial gobbldigook that you forgot the finer details of what they were even saying the worst part is by the end of the game i was convinced that story 2 was the more interesting story and i really really wish the game spent more time actually building it rather than giving tiny puzzle peices until story 1 ended and they decided ok lets dump it all on you at once in my opinion what they needed to do was supplement the motivation of story 1 with some motivation from story 2 to be specificic and specific spoilers ahead they needed to add motivation to go to the monolith other than to kill the paintress and stop the gommage that related to maelle or verso more intimately put consicely is story 1 good i really like it in act 1 liked it less and less in act 2 and if the game had ended on that fakeout after act 2 then i would call it the worst story i've ever seen in a game is story 2 good in act 2 it isnt in act 1 no i dont like it at all in act three though it gets more engageing than story 1 ever was last thing on story is the ending i also talked about the fake ending at the end of act 2 above but the actual ending of the game i liked it reaaaaaaaaly reminded me of ghosts of tsushima expect worse there are 3 factors when making a choice like the one in ghost of tsushima 1 what i as the player wants 2 what the character i'm playing as wants and 3 what the world the game exists in wants in this game for 1 i clearly wanted 1 choice over the other it wasnt even a debate given the lack of setup story 2 got vs how much i love the world established in act 1 2 the characters wants were pretty clear and 3 unfortuntely i dont feel like i had enough information about the world of the game to decise this game does not do a good job of setting up the world of story 2 so i didnt know and honestly didnt really care ok that's all promise this is probably the worst review i've ever written i feel slighly manic talking about this games story definetly should have slept on it but oh well we ball i needed to get these raw thoughts written somewhere tldr crazy fun combat but just a fine story experience easy 810,True,1760708978,1670,11
1903340,game made me cry i don't cry often but it did thank you sandfall and everyone that worked on this game one of the best games i have ever played enough said,True,1760708705,1429,18

1903340,reeeaally great and beautiful game but only up until the start of act 3 everything before that had me hooked the mystery the world the tone but once the story shifted killing the paintress i lost interest honestly the phrase for those who come after ends up feeling literally meaningless i havent finished the game yet but i feel like this wont change by the end lol what pulled me in was the idea of the gommage the strange and dangerous world the paintress the expeditioners verso whos not affected by the gommage and characters like gustave lune sciel and ofc esquie3 that mix of mystery sacrifice and discovery was what made it special to me but then all those interesting things got buried under the family that literally came out of nowhere plot twists and it really hurt the narrative the game built such a strong fing theme around perseverance like how the expeditioners gave their lives so the next generation could make it a little further even if they were doomed to fail i really loved that idea was honestly reminding me of aot a little bit when all odds are against humanity and survival it felt powerful and the saying for those who come after felt meaningful but then act 3 just abandons it and shifts focus entirely to grief escapism i mean everything feels disconnected with these plots and twists its still an impressive game and clearly made with a lot of love but i honestly dont unbderstand how people glaze the story lol still recommend the game though just the story is dookie not saying the themes are bad all im saying is act 3 ruined everything for me,True,1760703884,6361,7
1903340,this game offers a one of a kind experience and i would recommend it to everyone a refreshingly original unique and deep story that is both wellwritten and well executed this game will bring you to the highest of highs and the lowest of lows the voice actors all did very well and their lines felt real and emotional the music was something that can only be described as incredibly emotional or overwhelmingly epic it's difficult to stop playing when you've got addicting gameplay with some of the most epic boss fights and an intriguing mystery to solve the turnbased combat system is easy to play and complex enough to not be boring exploration isn't overwhelming which is just really nice unfortunately when you get access to all the areas in the world it's essentially end game and it ruins the pacing of the game it's unnatural to stop and explore the world when you got this big pressing issue that's supposed to be actively happening you can explore it after the final mission so that's nice at least,True,1760703385,1991,63

1903340,my review is quite late i do not normally review games and i struggled to describe this one beyond saying you must play it put simply claire obscur expedition 33 reawakened a childhood wanderlust it is only the second game in more than 20 years that has given me the surreal urge to journey and discover the world for myself the earliest game i recall giving me that feeling was the legend of zelda and more recently red dead redemption 2 red dead was more about immersion while e33 delivers an otherworldly experience i had no performance issues on my system with an intel core i711700k and an evga 3080 ftw as i progressed through the story i found myself constantly questioning and theory crafting where it would take me it was not predictable but it unraveled in a way that felt natural i wondered how the characters would travel and change and what they would learn about the world and their place in it the art style and music form a perfect backdrop to excellent cinematography writing and delivery the presentation is beautiful and rarely if ever misses a beat design influences i would relate to include bioshock alice madness returns persona devil may cry and final fantasy it feels like the best aspects of those series come together to deliver a memorable adventure the pacing was overall quite good the third act tightens up and several threads feel compressed but i did not rush through it i deliberately completed most optional content and finished nearly all side stories leaving only the toughest fights like simon for a post game return where i needed to optimize my build and practice my dodges that approach highlighted how rewarding the optional content and post game preparation can be character work is a major strength i badly wish one character who is lost early on had more screen time because his absence carried a strong emotional weight throughout the remainder of the story maelle is handled well she reads as her age while showing a maturity earned by struggle luna and cecile are welcome additions luna can be commanding and at times preachy but she never talks down without reason and she grows into the party rather than forcing herself on it at one point luna expresses joy at meeting the gestral village then i took a detour to the beach she sounds annoyed by us wasting time here with them which felt slightly inconsistent and jarring cecile is a joyful presence with a maternal or teacherly air that does not need exposition it just feels right her manner made me want to learn more the way the best teachers do their relationship never read to me as romantic in a shallow way they come across as sisters or best friends who may have drifted but would always have each others back the two later addition characters fit perfectly their banter and integration with the party felt natural one of them has a deep and interesting arc and a psyche that makes their presence meaningful without explicit explanation if i have to score it i give it a 9 out of 10 being nitpicky i might say 89 out of 10 because i noticed a few odd terrain moments while exploring off the beaten path such as waterfalls that seemed to end unnaturally on rocks and some jarring asset reuse in a few locations these issues came up only when i deliberately explored every corner of each level so they are minor but still present spoiler i really hope to see where they take this story next i can easily imagine some characters returning in a follow up but not quite as their former selves perhaps as figures who inspired their counterparts in that world one scene stood out as foreshadowing the two factions maelle is holding a cake while verso and clea stand among others on her left and gustave and emma stand on her right with a fairly distinct split between the groups it made me wonder if gustave and other characters in the canvas reflect someone verso or maelle knew in the real world who might be a part of the writer faction the characters we grew to love could become antagonists or at least appear in the next story without being entirely hostile since maelle and possibly verso have a connection with them spoiler,True,1760686248,4660,10

1903340,yeah the game is a masterpiece i would write a more detailed assessment but it really only comes down to a few factors either you have 50 and want to experience one of the best marriages of soundtrack visuals story and gameplay ever passionately made or you don't no pressure but this game has my full support for goty and i think i will always remember it fondly,True,1760668376,3353,34
1903340,this by far one of the greatest pieces of art i have ever experienced in my life the game forces you to actually think about the story its something i have never experienced or witnessed before there were so many man moments that made you just put the controller down and think in a age where every game coming out feels like repetitive soulless slop this game actually makes you feel something and thats something i am going to remember for a long time whenever i wasnt playing it i was thinking about it and that means something if you wanna play a game that lands in your top 5 games of all time play this game goty 100 top 3 game of all time 1010,True,1760668325,2157,48

1903340,the magic of clair obscur expedition 33 is embedded in its ability to give death a language the game's narrative dresses death in a wholly unique fashion through a captivating narrative with wellwritten complex characters and that's what resonates with me the most after all how do you communicate the unknowable inevitability thatarguablydrives us to do anything at all gameplaywise i had a lot of fun with the turnbased system which i wasn't expecting to enjoy because very few reconstructions manage to keep it engaging the entire dang time the game also gives the player a lot of flexibility in terms of things to do and explore without it straying too far from the central storyline i don't want to give away too much because i believe this game is best enjoyed blind if you're interested in what you see on the steam page but still feel a little unsure i encourage you to jump into the paint experience this piece of art and enjoy the ride along the way,True,1760662970,5310,13
1903340,i know i'm months late after beating this game back in june but i didn't think that i would finally play an indie that surpassed child of light as my favorite indie game of all time until now this game is not only the best game i played throughout this entire year but it's one of the best games that came out this console generation the story is a literary masterpiece that rivals fantasy franchises such as the lord of the rings in terms of the characters being very human in personality and going on an epic journey to save a civilization the gameplay is what modern final fantasy should have been where it's still turnbased but you can do other mechanics such as dodging and parrying attacks the game's visuals also look very good for an unreal engine 5 title where it looks like dishonored and bioshock infinite had a baby to create this game the music is beautifully atmospheric the only issues are that the mapping system in the game needs some work where the overworld has a proper map when traveling with esquie but if you're in a particular world you're completely on your own trying to figure out where to go a wave point system would've helped as well another issue is how inconsistent the dodging and parrying in combat can be regarding timing to avoid making a mistake this game is also pretty demanding for midrange hardware as well where my razer blade 17's gpu is directly equivalent to a desktop rtx 3060 ti and even then i generally get around 50'slow 60's in fps at 4k dlss performance at medium settings and the devs should really consider adding fsr and fsr frame gen for those whose gpu's are from an older generation that doesn't support dlssxess frame gen you're only option in that case would be to use software such as optiscaler or lossless scaling to add frame gen for those that lack the support another issue is the difficulty balance where even at the lowest difficulty the game's normalboss fights already feel like it's easier to die pretty quickly in the middle of the game's 1st act trainer mods were basically a necessity to make it easier to beat the entire game on pc i think if sandfall scaled the difficulty better in combat it would be more accessible for the average person to try out other than that this game is still a masterpiece in every sense of the word i recommend many people to try this out and i hope that this wins goty at this year's game awards,True,1760660352,1010,11

1903340,i'm not one to normally write reviews for games if i do they tend to be short or joke reviews not meant to be taken seriously hell i'm not even the kind of person to go around recommending games to people in general it's just not my thing however every single positive review of this game is true every single person calling this game a masterpiece they're telling the truth while i do have gripes over the turnbased gameplaycombat it's leagues better than most other turnbased rpg's i've played and honestly the gripes are rather minor for the studios first game combat starts off good enemies are tough but forgiving and it takes you time to learn the parrying timing and the builds for characters using pictos and lumina are plentiful and fun late game however it can turn into a bit of a bummer as you can easily begin to overpower most enemies including the final boss of the story that aside though everything else about this game is well words fail me in trying to capture the sorrow grief joy and wonder this game inspires from the breathtaking landscapes and enemy design that just look like beautiful paintings to the phenomenal soundtrack that to this day has me crying anytime it plays to the narrative direction and stellar voice acting the game hits every single aspect with the passion of artists inspired by god himself and the story holy fuck the story starts off as stated but it will begin to drop hints as to the overall plot here and there until by the end of act 2 you are left stunned shocked mouth agape as they reveal each major plot point that's been hidden in plain site the entire time it gets to the point where every single word delivered by the characters have so much weight and meaning behind them that i personally had to pause after each sentence just to make sure i was processing the mountains of information beind dumped over the course of minutes but not just the grand reveal the story captures and immerses you in the world of our cast and you end up falling in love with each of the characters learning who they are their ambitions goals attitudes life stories they're all so fleshed out that they feel like real people and when shit starts happening to them in game that relationship you build up with them comes in and hits you hard and it gets harder and harder as the story goes on and you learn the truth of everything it's so moving so heart wrenching that it will leave you in tears long after you set down your controller and turn off the game this game has touched me it has moved me and i have never felt so seen and heard by any piece of media in my life this game's story has helped me heal old trauma i thought i had let go of i feel as if the writers knew my story and wanted to tell me we hear you we see you we understand and we're here for you i cannot express accurately in words what that means to me but i hope that the people who read this review will understand what it means because i can't explain it without spoiling the entire plot lol essentially what i'm trying to say is that this game is in essence a love letter it is a love letter to art to artistic expression the creative process it is a love letter to the artist to the gamer to humanity and everyone who has an expressive creative heart it is an ode to what makes art art if you are a creative person if you like deep narrativedriven stories if you want to feel your heart ripped out and put back in along with a sense of catharsis that will leave you with a weekslong emotional high if you've ever created something as a way of expressing yourself then you will fall in love with clair obscur expedition 33,True,1760653550,1252,19

1903340,i'm going to list out my thoughts here and get right to it cons mocap jank model clipping such as the rose gustave holds or unrealistic item handling the cup full of wine being thrown around by gustave but somehow he still has wine left in cutscenes can detract from the immersion especially when everything else is working so much in its favour facial animationsexpression outside of cutscenes are non existent especially noticeable in attack animations making what should be a dramatic and dire situation seem quite goofy attack effectsrope effects are quite excessive the fx often explode over the models in a glossy distorted manner often compiling on each other and looking messy whilst the attacks are all incredibly hype i do wish i could see the artistry in them with more controlled and relevant fx overlays most enemy attacks don't suffer this problem it is mainly the player characters not a good game for game beginners not a huge downside but the game does make a lot of assumptions on your knowledge of video game mechanics in general this makes sense for a game that pays homage to so many rpgs of old but i can understand the frustration of those unfamiliar pros great pacing both narratively and mechanically i felt a flow through till the beginning of the third act never quite getting stumped but always having a challenge and a sense of direction movie quality cutscenes aside from jank mentioned before performance and script is crafted and delivered beautifully alongside a heart tugging soundtrack fun gameplay arguably the most important part of any game the parry system is a rewarding skill to learn abilities and skills bring a variety of strategy and with a dramatic flourish attacks hit with a punch against your enemies or right back at you beautiful art direction while i can see where some criticism in its shiny unreal engine appearance the different locations in the game and enemy designs ooze character whilst matching elegantly with the themes of clair obscur a wonderfully told heartfelt story that you can't pull yourself away from an instant classic,True,1760646196,4167,11

1903340,my simplified results will be at the bottom of this so i'll start by saying thius game its fine i have two issues on this story because the story is unique no game on this year's game awards including red riding hood beetle or sheher hades and stranded to death by too much cardio 2 got this level of story and the game style for me its kind of whatever because i do no play this type of turn base but the narrative the vibe the music and the style trumps it and that speaks volumes and the story mode helps gameplay the story mode difficulty is hard imagine the normal one god forbit a brother just be trying to enjoy the vibes granted most of my gameplay was a sonic game trying to go past the enemies and that ultimately didnt let me level up but we cant confirm for sure its a hunch sparring mechanics became the ultimate heartsopper i kept trying to figure out what the fck am i looking at if it was a leg or an arm or a vulva unpredictable hits every time these enemies need more coordination on how to hit and be less flamboyant about it which im fine by it we gotta keep in mind this is a french game and its a different culture but i also didnt see a lot of hijabs if this was inspired by france story here is the cream of the crop the story unpredictable surreal odd but flawed but dont worry because ill tell you the two issues issue 1 the story deals around mourning letting go of loved ones the conflict that happens either to cope with the person you loved or continue with your live there are also subtle touches of guilt and family relations all established on this fantastical environment i personaly cant relate to the characters the topics at hand are one dimensional and frankly i cant relate humph pumph issue 2 spoilers they killled my goat gustav this is unbelievable these pieces of dookie croissant devs introduced us with gustav in this beautiful world and showed him saying his last goodbye to his gf and at that moment i realized i am gustav he is me he got a cool mustache and he is equally as insecure on this dirty world as me fck he was a good person he even made a little journal for those who come after i used to stop for 10 minutes hearing the journal music taking it in after all we went through all of the sudden he gets killed like a doooooog my goooooaoat did nooooot had to die i am now empty i cant eat i only watch the loading screen of the youtube vids in silence because i only hear the deafening sounds of the humming from our journal sessions oh gustav and not only that after the big reveal that we found out that we can revive people we found that the only person that cant be saved was gustav fuck man c0ck teasing me like thatand on top of that after the big reveal we find out that our goals and dreams were for nothing nothing gustav died like a dog for nothing next time i see a french person im gonna remember them where were you when gustav fell i bet these stupid game devs are rolling over the idea of making me as the main character and die for nothing i cannot understand and then and then they swap him for gustav zero sugar aka verso he is fine character i guess but imagine going to work and seeing another person at your desk and he says oh you didnt know my summer is ruined i got ptsd when i hear french and i cant journal anymore conclusion fine game 810,True,1760635926,1291,6

1903340,i went into this game completely blind i have to say am amazed totally beautiful writing amazing voice acting surprising amount of post game content felt like there is more to do than the main story this game is 100 in my top five turn based rpgs list for anyone who is a big fan of games like persona like a dragon final fantasy etc u just have to play this combat stays fresh and innovative even in the post game did not really ever got boring or stale minor complaint i feel like some side dungeons could have been unlocked earlier or just lower their level cause through the main story there were so many dungeons that were too big of a level for you to beat it made me rush the main story a little to fast cause i felt like i could do them if i did one more mission but then u beat the game and u are still too low of a lvl to do them best part story writing the story and characters got me so hooked also just the art style of the game is very captivating and makes every monster every boss and encounters super engaging,True,1760633868,2837,1
1903340,long story short it's a masterpiece of aa games artstyle takes you to different dimension but it's the music that makes this game a pleasure even when there are some low budget issues game is simply a breath of fresh air of bold ideas synergized with very well known gaming patterns i felt like a child visiting a crazy playground where every game was about learning new things truly worth it's price and i can't even imagine how to beat such a strong entrance by sandfall interactive some problems i've encountered are bugs requiring reloading autosaves are plenty some frustrating plants and invisible walls that make exploration a hit or miss be amazed or be stuck in some bush some other features that kind of explain the price are very not balanced attributesweaponsskills system if you have some experience this game will be trivial and loot is shown as red or white light on the ground predictable but i felt like going back to dark souls this game is so artistic that such loot system and presentation seems very ordinary playable on 1650gtx not bad without controller not 1010 but easily 810 maybe 85 for innovations and style,True,1760632546,2172,75

1903340,i actually had to take a day to gather my thoughts about this game a 1010 game is a perfect game with absolutely 0 flaws is expedition 33 that no it is however one of the closest games i have ever played to being it the story is gutwrenching every single environment is jawdropping the music is fantastic it has funny moments it has moments that make you cry til you can't anymore and it has exploration that feels extremely rewarding with combat that feels skill based and fun i can not recommend this game enough and i am so glad i walked into it with the only knowledge of it being kinda turnbased but not really so why not give it a perfect score what deluded the gameplay for me well honestly just nitpicks the game's performance is not the greatest even with my kinda decent computer the fps goes down to 18 at times and i never saw it go over 55 at any time of course i played on the highest settings and i did not care that much but it is still a small problem the difficulty curve is a little funky as well i think at the start the game is pretty hard and every now and then you run into some really hard enemies spoiler the chromatic ones spoiler but you scale kinda fast and at a certain point i kinda just one shot everything spoiler the axons took two turns each tbf spoiler but a little later the game flipped again and i did basically 0 damage to any non basic enemy i found and everything oneshot me instead it was a bit staggering to encounter the switch spoiler even if it was at the start of act 3 spoiler but honestly that's about all the bad that i can come up with the game is phenomenal and has climbed near the top of my favorite games list i highly recommend it even if just for the story h1 9810 h1,True,1760611583,2077,49
1903340,i have to say this may be one of the most interesting games i have played the story is great so far such a unique and creative story the game is beautiful i find myself wondering around just looking at everything the combat is great though i'm still getting used to it the turn based is fun and keeps you engaged i can see why there was so much hype from this game highly recommend,True,1760609357,386,21

1903340,i'm one of those people that hates to spend money when they don't have to i was initially reluctant to purchase this game i usually wait for sales and even then i have a gigantic backlog to get through before i can start to justify purchasing games this one was overwhelmingly recommended to me as well as compelled to try based on the sheer amount of buzz surrounding it this is one of the few exceptions that i would go for a game at full price you know the game is something special when you're crying over a digital character you just met while starting the game 20 minutes in the storytelling the atmosphere the depth the music it's a wonderful masterpiece of a game there's plenty of moments where i just sit and have to think not because of problem solving but because i had to sit and mentally process certain events almost every moment in the game is screenshot worthy to an absurd point where you're blowing up your screenshot page in your profile to overwhelming percentages of just clair obscur not only that but this game perfectly presents how the gaming industry isn't lead by the big companies 30ish developers left ubisoft and made this what i would consider the game of the decade for me buy it and enjoy it one piece of advise don't minmax play the game through normally as intended don't look up guides don't do every single side quest until later in the game play through on normal difficulty and play the story first you'll thank me later,True,1760599795,3547,175

1903340,very solid game but the pacing of the optional content is terrible i recommend to go straight for the objective when beginning act 2 and to not fight any large enemies you find unless you're a god gamer or someone with a lot of patience because you finish act 1 and the world opens up quite a bit but actually not at all you'll more than likely be forced to come back due to pretty annoyingly designed boss encounters chromatic hexgapot guy crushing guy for example seems the devs want you to 1st continue with the story then head back after several upgrades in order to tackle the optional content unless you want to bash your head against enemies that 1shot you doesn't feel good on the hardest difficulty frankly even if it is optional there are other encounters throughout act 1 that are similar chromatic enemy encounters and those felt significantly better to learn and do even if the 1shot mechanics were still in place like they were space out optional content better next time,True,1760591959,1868,14

the inevitability of death in a doomed world ruled by forces so much bigger than any human being a story of resilience that shows how human ingenuity and determination to survive can overcome impossible odds not just the characters forming your party but also those met around the world or described in the numerous lore files from previous expeditions exude character and uniqueness no matter how big or small their role may be or have been narratively its a masterpiece that knows exactly when to turn the tables thwart the pacing move it up or surprise you with the unthinkable there are very few if any narrative faults or plot holes an achievement for a tale of this complexity and a testament to how a bunch of frenchmen in a basement could write a story that vastly surpasses 99 of the entire industry visually the world is nothing short of amazing i stopped more than a few times admiring the scenery with its captivating ambiance that is a mix of fantasy postapocalypse and hayao miyazaki acidtripping through the shire youll definitely get shivers from it as its architecture constantly shows you how small your party and humanitys remnants in general are in comparison to the lethal forces they struggle against h3exploration secretsh3 the map of clair obscur is divided into dozens of selfcontained areas dotted around a massive openworld some of them are small others sprawling and multilayered with dozens of optional and hidden areas often housing unique weapons upgrades abilities and bosses at first youll be limited in what you can access but as you progress more features and mobility upgrades allow you to access more and often harder ones combing every nook and cranny is rewarding as it will directly influence your partys combat capabilities and allow you to gather unique items used for quests in a world like this so alien and yet familiar in some aspects youll never know what to expect after the next jump climb or fall it never gets boring or repetitive in this aspect but instead you crave for the next unique ability or weapon nested in a remote corner or the next tremendous boss to test your might against the amount of secrets some more convoluted than others will be the joy of attentive explorers the lack of a worldspanning fast travel option can get a little annoying at least until lategame but its never a dealbreaking issue because of cleverlyplaced shortcuts h3combat system bossesh3 the crown jewel even if at first clair obscur might look like your runofthemill jrpg that couldnt be farther from the truth instead of a traditional turnbased approach that translates in a trade of blows and focuses on skill order alone this game will have you actively dodge parry shoot and qte your way to get most things done in theory you can parry everything if your timing is good enough and open up to powerful counter attacks in practice this is hard with a parry window worthy of the most difficult souls games and enemies that can muster from 23 to even more than a dozen different attack patterns learning each of them until you master the timing is the fundamental mechanic against the toughest bosses as is knowing what their weak spots are to shoot them with your guns and gain advantages on the hardest setting missing even a single dodge or parry especially in later phases usually means instant death for a character or even the entire party unless you instant kill your enemies first which becomes possible later on with the ridiculous amount buffs youll be able to stack practice makes perfect and it couldnt be more true a plethora of status effects weaknesses resistances and dozens of unique abilities that synergize with each other on top of completely different combat mechanics for every party member allow a degree of depth rarely seen in this genre most bosses in your path will feel like a true challenge and some even have multiple phases rolling you back to the first should your party fall at any point the spectacle of animations effects clever slowmos and particles only adds further weight and emphasis to a combat system that would already be excellent on its own h3character progressionh3 by roaming the world defeating stronger foes and leveling up youll be able to acquire skill points to invest in new abilities for each character and lumina points used to grant powerful passive abilities derived from the pictos you also find in the same way these have an enormous range of effects be them defensive offensive or support this system allows you to finetune the role and purpose of each party member on the field and when summed up with all the other effects from abilities and weapons gives a huge variety of combinations to experiment with the only flaw in all this is that lumina is a

1903340,absolutely amazing 1010 game but i feel like taking 2 full points off for a certain endgame boss that starts with s and ends with mon for me that singular boss left me on a sour note in an otherwise fantastic game i really dislike when games have bosses that require cheese builds i didn't use maelle the whole game and suddenly i'm forced to make specific builds to beat this ridiculously overtuned and frankly torturous boss no thanks you have a reserve team that the game never really requires you to use up until that point so i focused on the characters i enjoyed and was punished for it if i can beat every boss in the game up until the very end the challenge bosses at the end should be difficult but still feasible with the builds that i've used up until that point basically i really don't like when games require specific party members and cheese builds to beat a boss rather than using the buildparty combinations that i've worked on throughout the game it took a lot of joy and sense of progression out of the game for me sadly luckily the fact that it's an optional boss means i can still highly recommend the game but it was still super disappointing,True,1760534834,9322,1

1903340,this game just isn't fun art over function and gameplay is not the best strategy what's this game's often repeated selling point art style is also its biggest weakness combat is bad even though the game tries to innovate on the turnbased combat formula but ultimately fails how do you fight a giant upright wagon with random pointy sticks in a game where combat is all about dodging how do you dodge an artistic version of a random inanimate object with random silly bits shooting at you it's not impossible but it's not exactly an engaging gameplay unlike with more or less humanoid figures you have no way of knowing which part shoots which part hits walks unless you play the same encounter 33 times or use a stopwatch for every move your opponent makes and so combat becomes either a question of dumb luck or redoing the more difficult fights so many times you learn them by heart or just somehow muddle through enemies don't telegraph their attacks in any way the ui once again art over substance and functionality doesn't show any info on them except health even though the game relies heavily on weaknesses status effects buffs and debuffs which can dramatically boost your damage output you often run into enemies with heavy damage reduction which are just ridiculous bullet sponges unless you do something specific to break the resistance which again is not indicated in any way on the enemy or in the game's ui the whole skills interface is a convoluted mess and you will waste time trying to figure out how stuff activates moves between different slots etc while the game looks nice tries to do a refresh of the very traditional turnbased combat formula and puts lots of emphasis on story the gameplay just doesn't deliver and the confusing and unclear combat is too much of a bother to continue playing pushing the artistic angle at the detriment of gameplay is a bad choice,False,1760518219,746,17

1903340,i very very rarely give reviews to games iirc my last was persona 5 royal expedition 33 is an absolute fucking masterpiece of turnbased games the interactive parrydodge system is both ingenious for longtime fans but also for turnbased veterans looking for more interaction played the entire game postgame on gamepass on hard then bought it on steam again just to show how good it is only real ui issues are the picto system that's pretty much a mess unfortunately,True,1760506177,199,3
1903340,within the first intro i realized that this expedition 33 is special i absolutely love how this game hooks you in immediately and throughout its play through this is the first game that i've played since i was a kid that i was fully invested in the story and characters and never did it feel like a chore to complete even after i got the 100 it left me wanting more expedition 33 has something that a lot of games are missing today compelling characters and a beautiful world building with a unique game play loop that makes you realize why you got hooked on playing video games in the first place the passion that the developers clearly shows and is such a breath of fresh air from most generic corporate aaa slop being pushed out today my only complaint is that i wish i could experience the story for the first time again game of the year 100,True,1760505599,3173,3

1903340,i've played countless games in my life you begin to see the patternsthe echoes and motifs that rhyme across genres and generations it has become exceptionally rare to find an experience that feels genuinely novel clair obscur expedition 33 is that rare experience it is a masterclass in design composing its elements into something that feels utterly new the visuals look like a living painting the score is unforgettable and the story is mature and refreshingly original this is all anchored by an addictive and strategic combat system that is deeply customizable and respects the player's intelligence while each part is excellent their true magic is how they are woven together into a seamless unique experience that leaves a lasting impression where the experience falters however is on the technical front performance can be inconsistent and the game needs a bit more polish to run smoothly across all hardware there are other oddities in the game that while mods thankfully exist to address seem odd to exist at all for instance cutscenes play at 30fps rather than 60fps which feels jarring when going from gameplay to story moments however the developers appear actively invested in improving the experience which inspires confidence that these issues will be officially addressed in time in a medium full of familiar rhymes clair obscur is a bold original voice it breaks the rhythm we've grown accustomed to and proves that there are still new stories to be told and new ways to tell them if you've been waiting for something to truly surprise you your expedition ends here,True,1760500262,2446,44

1903340,h1 absolute cinema h1 i was hesitant of getting the game due to how hyped it was but it did not disappoint from it coming out of nowhere to being one of the top reviewed games of all time i would be shocked if it didn't get goty h2 the good h2 list the gameplay is fantastic the fusion of traditional turnbased combat with a skillbased parry system works swimmingly it's incredibly engaging and i hope more games adopt this style i struggled with parrying at first until learning there was an audio cue that i couldn't hear when streaming to my tv once i switched to by pc and its speakers i could clearly hear it and had a much better experience the soundtrack is phenomenal easily one of the best i've ever heard the story was wild and unpredictable i never knew what was about to happen and the actors' performances were top tier one of the most original stories we've had in a long time list h2 the notsogood h2 with how praised the game is it was hard for me to find legitimate criticisms before i bought it so here's what i had issues with list the movement is kinda janky overall it's fine but there are platforming sections and parkour challenges think chained together those can be annoying when your character decides to roll off an edge or not read a jump input the game took from the black myth wukong school of design when it came to invisible walls some areas have visually open spaces that are inaccessible for no reason the foglighting was a little dramatic and i would have trouble seeing sometimes most of the game looks fantastic and like a painting however there were certain areas where it got to be a bit much my screen would get washed out from the fog or it would be near pitch black in some of the dark areas your characters would pull out a lantern to light it up and in others they wouldn't for some reason list h2 the bad h2 it's ue5 so performance is not the best while static scenes look great lots of motion or particles can create shimmering due to the antialiasing i also had to run the game on medium settings with a 60 fps cap in order to not crash i never found the root of the crashing as my gpu temps and power draws all looked okay for context my specs are cpu i711700k gpu rtx 4070 ram 32gb the game ran perfectly fine at high settings but it would give a fatal error message and close after 1015 minutes h2 overall h2 the game is great especially at the price point as long as you can get it to not crash you'll have a good time,True,1760472735,1837,4

1903340,h3 what if the farmer and turkeys from 3 body problem have feelings for each other h3 this game has absolutely ruined my appetite for fantasy games because it dwarfed others' music story arch and character design coincidentally enough i learned from an interview that the director's favorite game growing up is ff series well congratulations to him and the dev team because they truly made a game dare i say a game comparably to some of the best ff entries but exceeding them in varies aspects the rest of the review has little to none spoilers spoilerfrom my past reading experience with pocket universe settings like this game the god is always cold and cruel while this game makes me feel like we are probably not that lonely and feeble in the vast and sometimes inconceivable universe with love care and inspiration for art it's not that bad of an existence as a speciespoiler we have the chance to experience master piece story like this me happy turkey noise,True,1760465323,4401,2

1903340,i bought this game despite sort of knowing i wouldn't like it mainly because i'd watched a few reviews that made me think it wouldn't be up my alley however it's difficult to ignore games that are rated overwhelmingly positive on steam so i decided to give it a go a few seconds after starting i was already annoyed by the developer's message suggesting i plug in my controller first of all you sold this to a pc gamer on steam and so i assume you realize that there are pc gamers who will not use or have controllers the game plays fine on a keyboard and mouse but don't tell me how to enjoy your game the game itself starts out very slow and artistic with long scenes of meloncholic views at the horizon which sets the stage for the plot the plot is revealed very slowly over the coming hours as you explore the plot itself seems interesting enough and there's a certain curiosity to continue playing it but after 12 hours i feel that there is unlikely a redemption arc coming that would change my review to positive for me what sells a game to a gamer is whether the gameplay itself is worthwhile and while the scenery is beautiful the gameplay just falls short of being enjoyable the complete lack of a map forces this sort of old school exploration that requires you to check every nook and cranny to find goodies more often finding enemies that force you into a fight which brings us to the combat the game reminds me a lot of nierautomata where you're wandering around trying to explore areas and getting into combat now and then but the above mentioned game is at least live action so you can run away or finish the fights quickly expedition 33 requires you to go into turnbased combat the mechanics of which are reminiscent of dragon quest and final fantasy from the 1980s you basically select attack or skill or use item or run away to use such ancient game mechanics felt like a really poor choice as well in what is a weird sort of merge between the quicktime event qte games like sekiro and dark souls genre and the aforementioned dragon quest and final fantasy mechanics of you go and then i go and then you go and then i go this game allows you to avoid all damage if your reflexes are fast enough so you can't simply say this game is a tribute to old school gaming since it rewards qte gamers more than those of us whose reflexes are long gone i began losing interest in the game when i started meeting some of the npcs who have similarly weird and meaningless dialogue like nierautomata but also seem to be some kind of take on despicable me's minions they have silly voices and sillier quests many of which are simply to get various cosmetic tweaks overall i fail to see why this game is anything more than a 610 but it may be a generational or genre divide that i don't understand i can see the merits of the game in some respects but the tedium of the combat the silliness of the gestrals the poor map and hud options and overstylized melodramatic cutscenes just didn't grab me,False,1760463143,755,191

1903340,this is a ireallyi fun ireallyi flawed game the combat is exceptionally satisfying but i dreaded every time i had to open the menu and navigate that ui the world is gorgeous but exploration can become a chore with no map or other indicator of where the heck you're going even a compass in the overworld please the characters and lore are incredibly rich but there are certain elements of the story that completely undermine the player's experience and i don't know if the writers truly understood the implications of those narrative choices the soundtrack is one of the best game soundtracks of recent years and honestly of all time the ending will stay with me for a while i think it's a great game that has issues so in other words a great game i can't wait to see what sandfall does next i hope whatever it is has heaps and heaps of qol and ux improvements though,True,1760455780,4001,22

1903340,legitimately one of the best games i've ever played masterpiece all around and it's actually insane that this would technically be considered an indie game incredible narrative and worldbuilding that always keeps you guessing and absolutely worth playing through at least twice to catch all the subtle hints you wouldn't have caught the first time through every single thing in this game feels handcrafted and deliberate the combat system makes this feel almost more like an action game than an rpg think paper mario meets sekiro though the parrying is stricter than the latter for sure my only gripe is the act 3 and postgame scaling because by that point if you've been paying attention to the core mechanics you'll be pumping out insane damage numbers i was told 2 things going into act 3 beeline the story and do side content after the credits and do not use the new pictos they hand you at the start of act 3 until postgame i followed that advice and it made it a much better experience,True,1760445651,6658,31

1903340,i started this game expecting it to be one of the best of 2025 fast forward to today when i beat it for the first time will probably play it again and not only has it surpassed all of my expectations it has become my favorite game of all time h3 technical aspect graphics h3 the weakest point of the game it's ue5 so get ready for noisy global illumination and shadows blurry presentation all throughout noticeable popin and a poor optimization that requires upscaling on an average midhigh end system h3 art direction h3 absolutely beautiful it is a masterpiece in every sense the character and enemy designs the use of different colours and aspect ratios for certain scenes the flow of the visual effects the creativity in the different sceneries every single detail you can think of is carefully placed and with a clear purpose behind it aside from a handful of moments you basically forget about all the technical issues because of how breathtaking everything looks h3 music h3 it's a masterpiece you can go listen to it right now on youtube or spotify if you don't believe me just don't listen to the lyrics especially if you know french because they are full of spoilers h3 exploration h3 very solid exploration is relatively contained but the lack of a map makes it engaging you really feel like an expeditioner discovering new things in a mostly unknown world and the game rewards you with currency to upgrade your gear new weapons and pictos stuff that gives you different buffs some side quests and harder bosses that give you even better rewards almost all of the side content contributes to the worldbuilding for instance without giving any spoilers you can find out what happened to previous expeditions and what they discovered h3 combat h3 in a word it is challenging it's turnbased but the enemies hit hard the game has dodge and parry mechanics the first being easier and the second giving you a chance to counterattack i played on expert difficulty and most enemies would kill me in 13 hits so i took my time to learn the parry timings this is what made me like the combat so much i usually don't like turnbased combat because i just have to wait until the enemy plays its turn and hope my character doesn't die with the parries i can actually do something and the punishing timings reward you with some extra damage if you succeed it's very engaging and fun on top of that you also have a lot of freedom when it comes to build variety oneshot shooter parryonly high hp for more survivability low hp for more damage and so on h3 story and characters h3 this is by far the best aspect of the game it hooks you from the very introduction even before you get to start the adventure you really feel for the characters and want them to succeed in their goals and aspirations the pacing of the story is excellent too just when you think you are figuring things out based on the breadcrumbs the game gives you the plot takes unexpected turns that keep you enganged from beginning to end i have to admit that the story made me cry a lot h3 verdict h3 if you read everything above you know the only thing i didn't like is the issues with ue5 everything else was basically perfect which is even crazier when you remember this is sandfall's first game ever clair obscur expedition 33 is the best game of 2025 and my personal favorite of all time 1010,True,1760417890,5925,16

1903340,i expected nothing going into this game i remember seeing 1 trailer during some summer event found it much like the rest of the games visually and only keyed in when i saw it was turn based i wishlisted it on a whim and when the game came out i purchased it i didn't know at the time i'd not only be playing my personal game of the year but also one of my top 10 favorite games of all time there is not a single aspect of this game i would change every single detail artistically musically acting wise visual design story is absolutely phenomenal this game is absolutely not lacking in praise but i'd be remiss if i didn't leave my own thoughts as a review not since nier automata have i been so blindsided by a game's emotional tone being lured in by the strange and attractive and stunlocked by the gutwrenching turns every chapter every time i felt that i had the game figured out i was reminded i wasn't giving it enough credit after the start of chapter 3 i actually considered not finishing the game i felt like perhaps they had taken a turn in the story i didn't like and i didn't appreciate the big reveal nor how the main character was acting i pushed through narratively because the gameplay was never a chore and what i saw unfold was a huge middle finger to myself that once again said why did you not trust me on this and such a phenomenal conclusion to the game that i could even feel it seared into my brain for the rest of my life on the off chance anyone reads this not sure if you should get this game amidst the 60k other reviews let me just say that this experience is a beautiful love letter to games that inspired it something very close to the hearts of the developers and something that will affect games and game design in the industry for a long time this game does not erase any predecessor but rather uplifts them and says please take a look at where we came from play this game you will not regret it,True,1760414957,2403,11

1903340,one of the best games of the year straight up it only has one weak point the game opens so well in what seems like a peaceful world and then it gets dark very fast there are so many moments of foreshadowing throughout the game that you only realize as the story unfolds and especially on a second playthrough that is when you truly notice all the hints about certain characters and events truly a fantastic story you can easily get lost in this game for several hours i have personally completed it twice once up to act 2 and this time on steam i finished it all the way story the story starts off almost peaceful only for you to realize that you actually live in a dark and twisted world especially with the paintress and everything that happens it is a solid 1010 and i rarely rate games that high but this one absolutely deserves it when you let devs cook this is what comes out of the oven there is so much clever foreshadowing that once you reach the end you will have that wtf how did i not notice this sooner moment music 1010 nothing more to add combat turn based so if that is not usually your thing give it a try anyway any og final fantasy fan will love this the only thing i truly dislike is the lack of a minimap the devs said it was meant to make you immerse yourself and feel like part of the expedition but by the time you reach the endgame it just gets annoying not knowing where you have been or what you have already explored that is not immersion that is frustration,True,1760408782,2697,1

1903340,pros interesting combat ive never played a turnbased game with a parry system before you can basically nohit run this game once you understand how the damage system works you can make a lot of your party members broken as hell cons this one is personal the thirdperson offset camera gives me motion sickness i really hope this doesnt become an industry standard very poor choice level design is bad there are no iconic landmarks and after battles youll often get confused about which way you came from sometimes you can jump down certain areas but other times youre blocked by invisible walls super inconsistent the characters are horribly written spoiler warning there are many situations where the party couldve just asked why the hell did this happen but they never do until its too late and when it finally is they hilariously blame the very person they shouldve been questioning earlier,False,1760407445,3887,3
1903340,if this doesn't win goty i'm gonna crash out everything about this game is absolutely phenomenal the art is gorgeous the music is brilliantly rich the story is captivating and the gameplay is delightfully challenging absolute masterpiece 1010,True,1760407373,4556,4
1903340,it's hard to recommend this game enough without sounding pretentious when i tell you that it both is art and examines art on more levels than you'd expect i'm not sure what that would mean to you when i tell you that it's both very silly and very dark and more emotionally rich than you might expect from the intro level it's hard to convey that and do it justice so let me say this the art in all its various forms the visuals the music the narrative are all magnificent and will move anyone with a soul you will feel a broad gamut of emotions the combat is elegant and challenging in a rewarding way i don't tend to go for intense mechanical challenges like in a soulslike or a jrpg but this game marries both and has increased my tolerance for such an experience because it's fun certain combat things called pictos you collect might overwhelm your menus at some point in a very inelegant way but they also provide a massive amount of variety potential replay value and straight up shenanigans if you love a good mystery then you'll enjoy piecing this one together the pacing is very good and you will be left theorizing and speculating and discussing in that way that great stories and art pieces make you do so if you love a good story a good mystery a sense of wonder and exploration and fun combat that you can make infinitely easier or harder for the most part to your taste you should pick up clair obscur expedition 33,True,1760404432,8240,7

1903340,one of the best game i've ever played best game of the year 2025,True,1760403998,3971,34
1903340,this game is fantastic i love turnbased rpgs and the added mechanics of having to dodge or parry or you die brings a nice challenge to the game not to mention how beautiful the game is and how amazing the music is the story is a fresh perspective on dark fantasy my one gripe is the fact it portrays the french as a likable people which almost kills the game for me,True,1760403644,1593,5
1903340,i feel a hole in my chest after finishing this game the story and the mystery with the soundtrack and the interactive turn based combat with fantastic voice acting and visuals on top it's going to be a while till a game quite as jaw dropping as this one comes out this is going down as one of the greats and has earned the title of my favorite game of all time,True,1760403262,5314,15
1903340,fatal error and crash to desktop every hour or two apparently other folks have it worse i really do not enjoy the reaction time system parry dodge especially how critical it is to game elements it lacks an indicator for most enemy attacks and all of the enemies moves are fakeouts so you have to memorize every enemy attack pattern to be effective the timing is super counterintuitive so i had to watch a youtube to learn about the sound cues game is more or less a movie with some turnbattle bits in between the story is good and the music is great art is mostly pretty impressive platforming is dog doo with clunky movement and invisible walls voice lines are well done and most dialogue is voiceover male characters look cookiecutter 410 not my jam,False,1760402457,2093,17
1903340,the visuals and soundtrack make a strong first impressionthere's genuine artistry here that drew me in initially map design the level design is frustratingly repetitive with no minimap to help navigate areas loop back on themselves in ways that feel artificially confusing rather than cleverly designed it creates tedium instead of exploration combat system while the game seems to aim for soulslike or character action depth the combat falls short you're essentially limited to blocking and dodging with little room for experimentation or skill expression it becomes monotonous quickly compared to the genre standards it's trying to emulate rpg elements the build system lacks depth unlike other roguelikes or rpgs where distinct builds define your playstyle nothing here feels memorable or impactful enough to encourage different approaches bottom line great presentation can't compensate for repetitive gameplay loops and shallow systems i don't recommend,False,1760401128,483,1

1903340,expedition 33 is hands down the easiest recommendation i could make of all the games i've played since maybe the mass effect trilogy if you enjoy beautiful worlds wonderful music or incredible characters there is something for you here if you enjoy turnbased jrpgstyle combat there is something for you here in the offensive side battle system if you enjoy western realtime combat there is something for you here in the defensive side of the battle system if you enjoy customizing and synergizing character builds there is enormous depth here the story is the best i've experienced in any media in a long long time a tale of love and grief you shouldn't miss out on do yourself a favor play this game i only really have one small critique of what i would still consider a 1010 game the next time out i'd like them to work a bit on signposting and progress tracking indications in this 50 hour open world experience it can get very difficult to know where you've been what you've found and what you're ready to face that's not all bad it provides some mystique but there's probably a happy middle ground between a map full of ubisoftstyle markers and nothing subtle art and label changes for instance would go a long way,True,1760393856,3459,35

1903340,i've already finished this game once minus 12 chromatic bosses on gamepass and i decided to start all over again on steam this game is amazing the story is well written the art style and the world itself is a masterpiece it is also very addictive i like the characters their stories everything really in the beginning i had to get used to the fights parry and dodge is tough because i play without camera movement the fights are so much better with camera movement but i get nauseous from it unfortunately but once i got used to it i really started liking the game game of the year for sure,True,1760387713,572,5
1903340,tldr it was a great game but it didn't blow me away or anything i certainly didn't feel the intense hype a lot of others felt for it for context i played this game and all of its side content to 100 completion the story is unique and the world is phenomenal i loved the emotional high points that helped contrast the emotional lows the characters were excellent for the most part but i did feel there should have been more time dedicated to interpersonal relationships and backstories most things you learn is through symbolic visuals text or interactionsdialogue where characters are standing in one spot just talking at each other and not doing anything if characters did actually end up doing something other than stand there it was often offscreen with a text description don't get me wrong i absolutely adore cerebral media that doesn't spell things out for you in black and white but maybe add a bit more overworld banter or something to endear you to these people even more to make it feel a bit more natural with all that being said the characters and story are the only reason i kept playing this game i understand this is a small indie team and there is only so much they can do with limited funds and resources on such an ambitious project but a lot of character models were too similar to each other there were definitely a lot of nonplot related reuses of character assetsmodels even among those closely associated to main characters this was confirmed by the lead designer who said that they used the same base model for every character for such a visually striking world most people within it were very lackluster this is entirely a personal preference but i do not like this games style of combat since i despise qtes character builds became insanely powerful which for me i loved oneshotting everyone including the hardest sideboss in the game but i could see people who prefer a challenge being disappointed by how overpowered you are in the late game i also have a love for fighting massive bosses and just seeing massive creatures in general most games can't seem to get the scaling and perspective correct and instead of an intimidating and fantastical vibe it ends up failing entirely clair obscur does creature scaling so well it was always so unsettling and satisfying to fightsee the monolithsized creatures the maps and exploration gave me anxiety because i always worry about missing items and there is no mini map it was hard to remember what places and areas i had been to or 100 completed which led me to waste a lot of time going back and forth i really wish there were better indications of where things are in the overworld map or at the very least a completion percentage for areas there is also no real incentive to starting a new game as you can essentially level up to 99 complete all sidequests and choose both endings without starting over there are no new outfits music records journals or story content new game is purely for harder combat and new loot with only one new joke weapon that if you didn't know about how to obtain before starting the game the first time will take multiple full game playthroughs which to me sounds nightmarish while most of my review is merely subjective criticism i will say there is one major objective issue i had with the game and that is performance i bought and played the game months after release and there was surprisingly no effort or patches to address the egregious nvidia gpu compatibility issues every single cutscene froze and stuttered effectively ruining its most powerful cinematic moments even some fancy end game cinematic boss moves that i'm sure would have been totally amazing to see would freeze or stutter which really killed the excitement and magic of it all i find it unacceptable that a lot of pc players are forced to install 3rd party mods if they want the game function correctly,True,1760387602,5076,11

1903340,the game is about grief and the weight of creation the voice acting is stellar the music is fire the creativity of the visuals is inspired the underwater level is so pretty the prologue is one of the best in recent memory the rpg combat solves a lot of the problems with console turn based combat by making you more active through attacks dodges and parries that leave room for you to show skill to win a battle it reminds me of what lost odyssey did but expanded really good fights in this game this is my game of the year silksong is a close second,True,1760365375,7133,28

1903340,right out the gate this game feels amazing loving the story so far the combat reminds me of legend of dragoon in several ways each character has their own quirk in combat there is also a dodge and counter mechanic which does take some getting used to but if you do die in combat 2 things happen the game asks if you want to send in the reserve party ie the ones you aren't using in the main party and if you say no it asks if you want to try the battle again no penalty or anything it just sets up the beginning of the battle again as it was on your first attempt it's a great feature that gives you the opportunity to learn when to dodge or parry counter to get the timing right with no runback like in soulslike games if you were somehow on the fence about this game definitely pick it up you won't regret it,True,1760359776,1022,10

1903340,if you have a life don't install this game it is way too addicting,True,1760355942,4500,9
1903340,forget game of the year this might be game of the decade i would recommend this to anyone and everyone just to experience the soundtrack alone amazingly well written characters and voice acting along with stunning visuals and sound design immerse the player into this incredible world the combat is turn based and reactive players will need to dodge and parry at the correct times to avoid damage whilst it was my first time experiencing this type of combat i can say that it was super fun especially with tougher bosses that would one shot you if you mess up its very rare that a game has the full package superb storytelling amazing characters phenomenal sound design and music super fun and satisfying combat system and breathtaking visuals usually even great games will lack in one of these areas but this game does not which is why i genuinely believe this is one of those games that everyone should try and see for themselves 9510 a near perfect game,True,1760354860,3775,19

1903340,as an not a big fan of turn based games it is worth it,True,1760352454,3209,1
1903340,this game is a work of art in the best way highly recommended for any jrpg fan and even to those who are not i have not been a fan of the genre really since the ps1 days and i still think this game is amazing great story great music innovative take on an old gameplay style amazing environmental design the levels in this game are just simply fantastic they take fantasy to a new level imagination is everywhere just wandering through the levels is a journey worth making,True,1760351893,4353,15
1903340,the main plot of the game seems to revolve around defeating the evil fatal error once you resolve that issue by forcing it to run in dx 11 i have no idea what it's about because all the cutscenes are just a big square at the moment i would consider the game between unplayable and a joke i feel like it might have a good story but again nothing works if you were at all on the fence i would skip this game until and if the devs can actually sort out these glaring issues,False,1760350658,657,8
1903340,i had way more fun than i had imagined a true top tier game one of the best games i ever played,True,1760349324,2689,16
1903340,originally this was a joke about me a british person not liking the french however a day or so after finishing the game i've been thinking more about it and i've come to the conclusion that i really didn't enjoy it the dodgeparryjumpgradient parry system ruins the balance of the game i say that as someone who could consistently parry enemy attacks on the second or third time seeing that specific attack either i a parry everything and take no damage whilst also dealing massive parry damage to my opponent or b get hit and die after like three combos neither option is great to be honest in the first case you end up breezing through everything the parry system making the game a breeze and more importantly largely invalidating build crafting because why bother with a 5 step combo with lune to build stains into mayhem or elemental genesis when i could just parry boss attacks and suffer no problems and in the second case i have to kill everything before they attack because otherwise i'll die i genuinely therefore cannot reccomend this game because it just isn't enjoyable,False,1760348712,1459,6
1903340,absolute cinema,True,1760347946,4040,11
1903340,came for the music stayed for the story gameplay isn't really my style but it works i'm usually a story skipper but please don't skip any of the story if you play this game you'll thank yourself later,True,1760346940,1672,37
1903340,just an excellent game probably not for people who dislike the old final fantasy style gameplay of looking in every corner for money items secrets and bosses and i mean every corner the story music world and character building are top notch i played like 25 hours in 2 days to play the main story through,True,1760346619,3383,12

1903340,ty french ppl,True,1760343855,2010,1
1903340,i refunded this game after a few hours of playing the story was intriguing and i would have liked to see where it went but the combat is awful i was expecting the parry and quick time aspect but did not realise that it is the only mechanic that matters there is no depth to the combat at all which is what makes turn based combat fun instead you mindlessly repeat the same combos every combat and try to learn the parry window which is where you do most of your damage quite disappointed to be honest was really looking forward to this one,False,1760342530,208,2
1903340,for me it took a while for the story to get going but once it does you can't stop incredible visuals turn based combat with a twist and characters that you will genuinely care about,True,1760341472,3444,8

1903340,no explanation need for this game,True,1760338438,4088,1
1903340,i really want to give this game a good review i really do but unfortunately despite all of it's excellent moments it has glaring flaws that can be vastly detrimental to enjoying the game but i'll start with the good this game is truly dazzling from story to graphics character development mindbending enemy design a truly unique experience and even the gameplay despite the major flaws which i'll get into is very fun when you're on it's good side i can almost recommend this game just on this stuff alone cause this is a masterclass in building a world that feels real to the player aaa devs should take notes the flaws man i played this game on the mediumnormal difficulty originally intended the hardest difficulty as i normally do as i have with even games such as doom eternal but honestly i don't think the difficulty you play at actually matters because here's the thing whether or not you win fights is completely on whether or not you dodge abilities on time normally this would be great design however there's literally no form of indication for said abilities or a general idea of when to dodge and that wouldn't matter if it wasn't so goddamn punishing when you mistime it despite meeting a new enemy with new attacks and intentionally delayed or offtime attacks to trip you up but man if you don't dodge you're going to wipe a lot like most of the game i spent save scumming and restarting 90 of fights just to learn the new attacks i would agree and say 'skill issue' but i don't think this is good game design it should feel natural when to dodge when seeing an attack and if it isn't you need a visual cue so despite how much i love everything else i can't recommend this to most people it's far too aggravating to actually enjoy the game,False,1760335845,929,4
1903340,one of the best stories of the decade in a video game magnificent,True,1760335773,2213,24
1903340,this is one of the best experiences i've had with an rpg to date and i think its because it hits all the notes that made me fall in love with this genre since the original final fantasy on nes the pacing more than anything else makes this gold you can fly through it to resolve the story or do like i did and let yourself get immersed into the beautiful and oft times nightmarish world there isn't anything like this right now themewise but with the popularity that is sure to change we all benefit from this game's existence and you can feel the love behind it in the presentation story and direction nothing feels contrived or made to check off a box to get us buying it just feels like art buy it,True,1760335622,5240,3

1903340,good game interesting story creative world and monster designs and excellent music that come together to make something that stands alone the game systems take a little getting used to as each playable character has different core mechanics but this makes for a lot of flexibility in composing your party and it's fun to have more to learn fairly far into the game when combined with a lot of influence on your build from things you can equip and abundant respec resources you have a lot of freedom to play around with builds and find crazy layered combos the ability to concoct elaborate combos does affect the middle to late game where you can go quite quickly from doing ok to being overpowered if you explore too much before advancing the story in the late game i'd recommend just forging ahead with the story to keep the fights with high story stakes challenging after which you're able to do postcredits exploration which unlocks some much greater additional challenges,True,1760330033,4882,21

1903340,clair obscur expedition 33 is a master class on intelligent game design combining our favorite parts of soulslike gameplay with classic jrpg combat and open world exploration this game has a little something for everyone as you explore the dying world beyond the notable combat systems that grow increasingly more difficult as you progress through the game clair obscur's world and story are easily some of the best i have seen in recent years encouraging the player to grow attached to the characters and become emotionally invested in their story as they traverse the world in an attempt to reach the paintress whom sits upon her monolithic throne the original sound track and sound design for the game only adds emotion to the game and allows the player to completely immerse themselves within the world easily better than most modern aaa games with a significantly smaller team and budget this game will easily sit among some of my all time favorites alongside bg3 silksong horizon and more 1110 this game is an absolute masterpiece for those who come after,True,1760324869,5245,30

1903340,if you have even the slightest hesitation read this but ill warn you now there are spoilers so maybe dont read it at all xd i keep asking myself if im even worthy enough to praise this game because if this doesnt win game of the year i honestly dont know what should i dont even know where to start because the art the music the environment design everything is just breathtaking its made by such a small team yet you can feel how much heart and purpose went into every part of it you can tell they wanted to create something meaningful its worth every single penny the music is absolutely outstanding i tried to find something to criticize but its honestly hard maybe the only small thing id say is that maelles voice actress doesnt perfectly fit a 16 yearold girl it felt just slightly off to me but thats barely even a complaint more like nitpicking it doesnt hurt the game in any way overall the game is incredible having two different endings and being able to experience the story from everyones perspective is such a thoughtful touch every single character has their own story and theyre all beautifully written you keep wondering about their pasts their reasons their emotions it constantly makes you want to learn more i havent been this curious about a game in years and that curiosity makes you want to keep playing nonstop the character designs are amazing even the smallest enemies are designed with so much care and detail movement through the world feels smooth the dialogues are entertaining and the characters genuinely feel alive theres real depth here the third arc was incredibly fun i saw people saying they stopped after the first chapter but dont do that losing gustave broke me but that scene was absolutely brilliant both emotional and cinematic being able to find hairstyles and outfits in the game and actually equip them was such a great design choice it makes you feel even more connected to the characters everything about esquie is just pure joy the idea of discovering parts of the map that normally stay locked using her is genius whoever thought of that deserves praise even her fallingonthebelly moment made me laugh so hard i still think about it i even bought her little plush already theres almost nothing i didnt like about this game and its the first time ive played something like this expedition 33 isnt just a game its an experience worth living and seriously congratulations ive never played a game like this before one that truly made me want to keep playing this is what real game development looks like especially saying this i am whee but i am also whoo so the whee balances the whoo rating 1010,True,1760298824,3102,6

1903340,goty ts so good,True,1760288109,2725,3
1903340,don't read anything online don't read reviews don't watch videos go into this completely blind don't google anything during playthrough just experience it for yourself i did that i intentionally avoided any information about this game other than seeing glowing reviews even skipped reading those mostly i have a few games i played in my long life that i would say are proper art form elevated beyond what one expects in such medium this is one of them firmly sitting near or on the top don't think don't read don't search just play it,True,1760288089,2382,8
1903340,if possible i would put this as a maybe but as i have to pick between yes and no ultimately i choose no expedition 33 is a game about closure that ironically does not know what it wants the game pretends it is a turn based rpg however there are so many quick time events that being able to parry is a much more important skill than understanding the mechanisms behind team comp parrying is so good that if you're not doing it the game will feel like a punishing slog if you are doing it you don't need the turn based aspect because you can kill nearly every encounter easily the story wants to wrench at your heart strings and make you think however after dramatic moments when people are actively sobbing you will also encounter the gestral beach nearby where you can do jumping puzzles to put your depressed sad women in bikinis the game wants to present a terrifying and mysterious world ala bloodborne but at the same time keeps enough light hearted optional side areas around that the tone frequently whiplashes the story builds up to a climatic choice spoilers ahead will you return to being a crippled and disfigured girl for life or remain in a world of wonder with loving friends and family facing reality vs escapism all that build up about the complexity of life is reduced to a trite binary choice not even mentioning that one essentially kills the entire magical world so you can go sort out your upper class parents fighting over who can be maladapted better and you of course regardless of your choices can do new game because in a game about choices and closure there's nothing like replaying it and remaking your choices this is something fancy game reviewers sometimes call ludonarrative dissonance lastly i need to critique the game itself i needed 2 mods to actually get the game to run without crashing one for the combat to stop crashing thanks directx12 and one for the cutscenes to not crash because if you switch to dx11 to fix the formeryeah no i make it a rule not to recommend games that don't work out of the box and this game did not the game has lovely worldbuilding a fascinating environment a great hook to start you out and solid visual design unfortunately it can't choose what it actually wants to be between its combat its story and its fundamental game design ultimately i much more enjoyed act 2 than anywhere else because act 3 felt trite and act 1 drip feeds you the tools you need to actually enjoy things so i lean on the side of no because there are much better rpgs out there much better turn based strategy and much more coherent stories that don't muddle their metaphors,False,1760287653,1848,49

1903340,1010 revolutionary a beautiful and incredibly original game with a deep and moving story expedition 33 has such well written and mature characters and a script that assumes you are an intelligent adult and doesn't spoon feed you superb turnbased combat the game is fast snappy getting in and out of battles is a dream and the ui is always responsive the battles are very satisfying highly recommend playing this at 60 fps if you can ultimately this is a fantastic turnbased jrpg at the core with an incredible french spin and lots of modern and well implemented gameplay mechanics the voice acting was wonderful throughout and i think andy serkis was superb as renior the soundtrack to this game is phenomenal they knocked it out of the park so many beautiful moving tracks but also upbeat epic and fun tracks as well many of them are stuck in my head days after playing the game it reminds me of the original final fantasy vii soundtrack i highly recommend watching skill up's the making of clair obscur on youtube to learn more about the small team behind this game and better understand their achievement,True,1760279885,4683,35

1903340,having finally finished the game i can now say confidently that this is probably going to be impossible to top as goty but you gave it a thumbs down earlier yeah that's called a frustration thumbs down i did that to blow off steam over the simon boss fight maybe i will give him a fair shake for ng but let's get on with the review first i'm starting with the core mechanics you might think that doing a jrpg with qtes is a stupid idea because qtes are a stupid idea but somehow the french have innovated a hybrid actionesque qte and jrpg game that in almost every sense combines the best of both gone are the days of needing to do resource management through the early stages gone are trying to optimize weapon and armor buildouts instead the devs relied on a simpler weaponattributepicto balancing that allows for creativity put squarely in the player's hands this is combined with the innovative parrydodgesuper parryjump system that crucially makes it so that grinding is never necessary there is never any boss or monster that requires you to grind if you learn the enemy's attacks and stuff now granted some monsters are more annoying than others and a few of them simon the scavenger the hammer guy i am convinced have drifting parry windows that are cheap in a way that detracts from the fun but those encounters are still beatable and even cheeseable so you're never stuck except maybe for the hands guys until you get the ability to blow past 9999 damage the story is also fantastic the twist after act 2 legit caught me off guard and is the kind of twist that in lesser hands could have ended in disaster but the ending was legit touching and thoughtful and i hadn't been this engaged in an rpg's story since you guessed it persona 5 but i think this actually beats out p4p5 most of the characters playable or otherwise are fleshed out enough and i think like 95 of the lore made sense importantly they left the door open for future adventures and with me wanting more there are weaknesses in the game but as one commenter helpfully pointed out as if i didn't know the truly shitty encounters are mostly optional except the scavenger boss who can rot in capitalh hell there are occasionally monsters who as i said earlier are more difficult to parry because of inconsistent parry timing which i think is unfortunate since the parry mechanic is basically the heart and soul of the game's combat and some enemies just sorta punish you for trying to use it why why do that devs this brings me to simon yes i know guys simon can probably be cheesed to hell yes in theory if you are a god gamer and just parry him you can't lose and i am 100 sure there are giga gamers who can beat him blindfolded with a ddr pad and can oneshot him with some fucked up build i am willing to bet though that the average e33 player isn't really going to be able to figure out how to beat him because he's specifically designed to a undermine almost every way for you to defend yourself and b be as irritating as possible because you have to mulch through at least 67 minutes of his first phase before you hit his fucked up second phase where even on easy he can teamwipe you with one of his obnoxious rapidfire 500hit attacks and i was already at like level 85 when i fought him so being underleveled was not an issue that entire boss fight had to go back to the drawing board and thank god it's not necessary but still i'm not facing him again until i can legit blow him out of the water before he gets a turn in i do not respect that boss fight aside from that i think there are only minor complaints left 1 exploration does not feel that rewarding because you're either searching for lumina or pictos or the occasional weapon there simply doesn't feel like enough types of items lying around to make exploration that interesting even if it benefits you perhaps in a sequel there could be accessories and such for the player to usewear or maybe some other kinds of items so that poking around can give a wider variety of stuff to pick up and yes no shit i know pictos are basically supposed to substitute for armor and stuff but it gets very samesy having few things to actually look around for that are useful not counting records and stuff 2 gustave and his gf's storyline kinda just goes out the window after act 1 i was surprised he didn't come back at all given that an entire game mechanic was built around him and i was also surprised the flower lady gf didn't make a comeback because i was sure that nevron that planted flowers and wasn't killed was like her or something but that was based on an incomplete understanding of what being gommaged meant i guess i'm not sure what could have been done to flesh out that story mind you but it does feel like the first third of the game was building that aspect up only for it to be chucked like so many cybernetic arms 3 the final bosses if we're also counting maelle and i guess verso if you go the other route being piss easy also threw me i was afraid they'd do something fucked up a la simon but instead i was clearly overleveled only at 89 though but even on hard this would have been a cakewalk and i guess they were only calibrated for players who mostly skipped the optional areas before moving on to dark lumiere i think it might have been a little fairer if there was some final boss leveling just to keep things interesting and if i had known how od i was i would have at least switched back to hard 4 as beautiful as the game looks the copypasting of character models for regular lumiere was disappointing also some of the npc animations of the humans look awkward a kid pantomimes crying despite his face not moving which was endearing but also technically not good despite those shortcomings the game really deserves the hype and i will go back for more ng when the dlc is released so if you're reading this in the future uh i will have played the dlc but probably not come back to update this review anyway i stand by my simon criticism and look forward to slaughtering him with a disrespectful cheese build oh ps if for some reason you haven't played the game yet and read this review and got spoiled on some shit i do recommend playing the game on french audio despite what appears to be some poor lipsynching to match it the english voice acting is flawless but for some reason a game set in france has people who speak in english and even scottish accents at least get some pepe le pieux english speakers who can do a french accent if i had known i could have used french audio from the jump i would have or if you're not put off by angloids saying merde and putain go crazy i can't stop you anyway pps speaking of which and this is a general problem for subs in games but if i play with subtitles on i expect there to be subtitles whenever a character says something including in battle my franch is not good enough to translate what lune says before she blows someone up with lightning bolts or whatever throw me a bone please,True,1760240983,5807,23

1903340,holy crap what is everyone gushing about this game sucks i suffered 8 hours of it and i couldn't take it anymore i just went off and googled the spoilers for the story so i wouldn't have to play the game to get to it because why cause the game is boring and just drags on and the unanswered questions are the only reason i kept playing the ui is clunky as hell and in some cases just makes no sense the game starts out so slow and this goes on for several hours there's way to much frontloading that just leaves you asking more questions then when the front loading started the pace is horrible they introduce different mechanics with each party member but don't explain it well enough or give you direct understanding of how to make the combat actions produce the promised results and why is this an issue because the freaking ui info for those combat actions is also clunky and does not explain itself what do these icons mean is this a fire icon does this ability cost or produce that resource how many ability points or resources of fire etc do i currently have available to spend don't know cause the ui sucks being able to upgradeprogress your weapons and attack skills is put off until way too far into the game it's so frustrating by the time i was able to get to the point in the the game that they would let me the resources i had would only take my weapons up to level 3 and already had level 4 weapons so it didn't matter and do you know why else it didn't matter because i was sick battling it out by that time and had put the game in story mode that's why glad i googled the story spoilers i would have been disappointed even more if i played 30 hours to get to its end i don't get why everyone is ga ga over this game it just really is not good and i'm offended that i was convinced otherwise if i had a box copy right now it would be so cathartic to take it into the back yard and burn it in the fire pit just thinking about it puts a smile on my face and makes me feel better,False,1760236041,500,10

1903340,words alone couldn't quite capture the artistry clair obscur commands to rattle the bullet points a truly legendary heartfelt 7hr soundtrack running the length of classical bliss to electric beats to rockopera epics some of the most visually striking environments in the gaming landscape each one a painting in of itself a really damn good turnbased combat system with parry mechanics rhythm game style as well as party and elemental synergies that keep things fresh always a poignant story about the usual suspects grief love family etc but presented in such a damn solid narrative that it pulls you in effortlessly and makes you invested in the cast and if that wasn't enough it's being sold as a first project from a small team with some incredible va acting and graphical talent packed into a price tag lower than the modern standard this game this work of art is a dream to experience and a splash of cold water to sit and think on some of the best talent i've had the pleasure of witnessing in recent memory i deliberated on writing this review as i feel like many others have put it better but this world needs to know that i adore clair obscur expedition 33 and possibly the best recommendation i can give is that every single time it is worth experiencing for yourself sandfall you've outdone yourselves and you deserve your flowers we continue and if nothing else i beg listen to the soundtrack lorien testard is a genius composer and alice duportpercier's vocals breath the divine into these songs we even get a duet with her and ben starr who also voices a character in the game to die for,True,1760230324,5975,12

1903340,one of the best games i've ever played it's best experienced knowing as little as possible there's a great steam guide that provides spoilerfree builds for all characters that is helpful if you want gameplay advice i recommend most people try normal mode yes the combat is tense and challenging but it's thrilling 'getting good' is not as bad as it might sound and it is absolutely worth the effort nevertheless i don't say that to gatekeep there's no shame in playing on a lower difficulty and you'll still have a wonderful time just give the challenge a chance make sure to buy the soundtrack and also download the bonus soundtrack on their website but don't listen to any of the songs until you hear them ingame the soundtrack is divided into acts but be warned that they don't reflect the order you hear them in the story there are songs in act i of the soundtrack that you won't hear ingame until the end of act 2 or even later many of the songs are subdivided based on the names of locations such as flying waters you can usually listen to those groups of songs once you've cleared the region with the same name,True,1760224122,5246,80

1903340,this game truly blew away my expectations the characters all have depth the music is phenomenal the gameplay is incredibly fun and addictive the exploration is rewarding the game looks absolutely beautiful there is really good enemy variety the game can be easy or incredibly difficult depending on your settings character progression and build experimentation is probably one of the most fun parts of the game replaying on new game was even more fun than playing it for the first time especially since you can actually understand all the little references in the first half of the game that all being said i have to talk about the endings i chose the good ending the first time around and i didn't really have a problem with it then i played the game a couple more times you spend so much time developing the characters and forming relationships throughout the entire game but no matter which ending you choose it feels wasted and hollow like it never mattered none of your choices or progressions impact the result of the chosen final ending literally everything up until the ending of this game is fantastic but then they fumbled at the finish line but it's about the journey not the destination had the ending been better i would have given this a 1010 however due to it i'll give it a final score of 910 100 worth playing,True,1760217839,4219,108

1903340,there aren't any spoilers below great rpg that combines elements of paper mario and a ton of sekiro focuses a great deal on presentation and narrative rather than strictly lore and worldbuilding with a cast of characters and dialogue that is easy to enjoy even if a handful of them don't get enough time in the spotlight to really shine despite being stuck with them all game the first half of the game is pretty packed and doesn't really miss a beat the endgame is a bit of a miss and directionless at times even with respect to what it was actively trying to dobe breaking the seemingly intended sequence can easily result in a lot of encounters just being ruined due to the nature of finding absurd upgrades well before you're meant to have them i do like that the setups and approaches to optimization in the first half are drastically different to that in the second half though due to the major restriction in place after you unlock the last mechanics by the end though one of them doesn't really go used outside of 5 or so specific encounters and this is of course assuming you aren't already at the point of 1shotting everything in the advent of metaphor and this game's release it's nice to see more streamlined approaches to the rpg format for those that don't have a lot of time to sink into grand scale 80 hr long stories i do hope though that the standard this game sets doesn't actively shake up things too much in the scene as one who didn't really ever drop turnbased games when the final fantasy series jumped ship and switched primarily to action in addition to many other classic rpg titles i think there's still a place for those really long adventure titles that can't really be replaced by games like this regardless this game gets high marks from me and is an easy recommend even for people who don't actively like the turnbased genre it's streamlined has funny builds funny characters a handful of serious topics and treats the player like they're an adult,True,1760215393,4057,23

1903340,months after i've played this game i still often think about what a great game this is i have a hard time finding enjoyable games in the sea of games these days but expedition 33 captivated me from the beginning i always enjoyed turned based combat but for anyone reading this and has doubts about the battle system i would say give it a try i'm sure that anyone going into this adventure with an open mind would enjoy the combat the story is amazing i've been gaming for more than 20 years and i gotta say that this story captivated me from the beginning till the end and the game easily fits into my top 10 games ever played maybe even in my top 5 the devs poured their hearths into this game and it shows what a great experience this was and i would recommend it to everybody,True,1760197591,4040,3
1903340,okay so i am obviously not far in yet not anywhere near done but damn me that is a rollercoaster if a game can make me cry within one hour of the start well it might just be something special the music the graphics the settings the voiceacting all of it is impeccable and so far forms an incredible whole mixed together with really satisfying gameplay only issue now is that i hate myself for waiting to play it so long,True,1760197008,457,9
1903340,abosolutly stunning visuals and gameplay i love turn based rpgs and it is aparant they creators did too final fantasy shadow hearts lost odyssey and a few other inspirations are very aparant in here and i love it instant classic,True,1760196857,4839,3
1903340,this is an incredibly good game that is just a step away from being a true masterpiece and it doesn't seem to be due to the lack of talent more due to the lack of scope which is understandable since it is made by a relatively small studio so i will definitely be waiting for the next games from these devs as i feel that with the resources they now have they might create some of the best games ever made the only thing that might not be for everyone is the combat i had a lovehate relationship with it throughout the playthrough but i did end up ultimately enjoying it though it did take installing a couple of quality of life mods also note that you can easily overlevel by doing the secondary missions like oneshot the end boss type of overlevel so if you want to experience proper story bosses i would suggest leaving the secondary locations for the ng otherwise the game has a beautiful soundtrack a unique visual style and an interesting story though the story is somewhat short hence the lack of scope i mentioned before as some story beats just don't have enough buildup i feel like out of a 50 hours playthrough it can probably be done in around 20 if you ignore the nonquest locations the game only had like a couple hours of actual story content with the rest being combatexploration and with how well the storydialog is done here i really wanted more than i got overall i definitely recommend this game and i will surely be replaying it in the future especially since there is more additional content on the way,True,1760196317,2969,27
1903340,overall score 910 this game is really beautiful amazing combat engaging characters exciting world and story definitely a strong contender for my game of the year encountered a few technical issues during my play through such as artifacting a weird red miasma over darker scenes and infrequent crashing but i'm unsure how much of that is nvidia driver issues versus issues with sandfall interactive's programming my only real complaint is with a particular optional boss just being way to steep of a difficulty increase in a game that is already difficult i look forward to more adventures in this universe if we get them the red miasma effect can be fixed by going into nvidia control panel going to managed 3d settings program settings selecting expedition 33 and changing anisotropic filtering to application controlled the artifacting and infrequent crashing was fixed by just reinstalling nvidia drivers after my pc went to sleep,True,1760195982,2660,6

1903340,the premise of the game is as dramatic as the stunning visuals and zooming panning camera which gets more action than my fingers do on the controller let's start with the premise the world is ending because people are dying yearly based on their age all the 34 years old characters dramatically pass away in flurry of flowers at the start of the game leaving the those 33 years and younger to form expedition 33 in search and destroy mission to find the mysterious paintress and right from the start the juxtaposition of this brutal reality with a cute french theme operatic music baguettes and effeminate males is discordant i'm not sure if this is trait expected from jrpgs and but whatever it is i'm not convinced that i like it it lacks grit it lacks the understated it's as if the director wanted you to wallow in the emotions of the characters so you can feel every nuance of the game environments where corpses litter the field in the thousands are not needed to convince me of horror a handful will do similarly the camera work is equally dramatic i feel it does more actions per minute than you do while playing the game it's always zooming in zooming out panning shooting up and down however many degrees of freedom it has all are used within a few seconds just chill a bit with the stuff i did not like out of the way lets get to the good bits the gameplay and combat is fun there's a lot of depth in the semi turn based combat i say semi because when your characters are attacked there are windows where you can get them to parry or dodge these are important mechanics to master since without at least dodging your party will wipe if you've played sekiro you'll find the parrying familiar the game makes parrying a skill based action because it provides audio and visual cues in that tell you when to hit that parry button additionally there's none of that artificial difficulty that creeps into soulslike games where you fall of an edge and die the game doesn't punish you for errors that are not related to the gameplay this is one of the flaws of soulslike games that expedition 33 avoids and it avoids making the player feel like they are grinding tldr if you can pack an emotional tampon to handle the sentimentality that oozes through this game and enjoyed the parrying mechanic from sekiro and like the puzzle aspect of turn based combat then this game will scratch those itches recommended,True,1760188645,2252,19

1903340,i've completed the game in roughly 69 hours on game pass and bought the game on steam right after the developers deserve every bit of support in a time and age where a lot of new games feel hollow and designed to rob me of my money here comes clair obscur expedition 33 this game is not your standard video game it is art in its purest form i'm mesmerised by this game the score the graphics the art style and the story i don't have a lot to say about this game it is hands down my very own personal goty i'm still trying to get my feelings in order and sort my thoughts after the final conclusion to the story,True,1760183286,26,6

1903340,one of the best games i've played in a while the story is gripping and touching the characters are all deep and compelling with good interactions between each other the music is some of the best game music ever it looks beautiful the turn based combat is very fun and has echos of final fantasy x though reactionbased dodging and parrying matters a lot here the game respects your time and has a great deal of content i pretty much 100 the game because i was having so much fun,True,1760162389,3893,52
1903340,i will say my playtime is shorter than a lot of other reviews and that is because i mostly only engaged with the main story and did some side activities that being said the main story is amazing and it taking me about 22 hours to beat just the main story on my opinion makes this a pretty long game but to sum up the game without spoiling anything it is a fresh take on turn based combat it has some of the best music i've seen in a game it has one of the most interesting stories in recent memory all of the characters were memorable and well written and it looks great and runs pretty well i don't really have anything bad to say i just hope that if they continue this world that they keep making it with the love they put into this game,True,1760161108,1322,17

1903340,i completed clair obscur expedition 33 on the weekend of my 33rd birthday still here thank goodness and i was surprised to find myself comparing the experience to the first time i played halo combat evolved silent hill 2 dark souls and kingdom hearts 1 i was playing a new favorite game as i played through expedition 33 the thought that kept coming to mind was that the people who made this gamefrom the art designers to the writers the composer and the programmershad a shared vision and executed it beautifully this game did not feel as though it was made by various departments but rather by a relatively small group of people who brought their respective skills to the table to create something beautiful meaningful and very fun i will not go into a full review the gameplay does deserve plenty of praise for its depth and great taste in inspirations but i need to touch on one element that stood out to me in particular as someone who does not usually require a stellar story or compelling characters to enjoy games expedition 33 needs to be commended for the way its characters are written no one is a standin for a flavorofthemonth political cause and no one is the selfinsert of a theater kid living out their ya novel fanfiction power fantasies an issue i had with bg3 every character in this game lives an incredibly tragic existence and they behave appropriately in light of that while also briefly allowing for levity at the right moments the characters are not meant to represent you or me they are meant to serve an amazing story and one cannot help but grow attached to them for it i cannot recommend expedition 33 enough even if turnbased rpg's are not what you normally go for it is an inspired and muchneeded masterpiece in our age of soulless iterative forevergames,True,1760153920,4133,1
1903340,if you heard this game is fantastic then i can say you haven't been lied to it's really hard to find a game where everything is in place the story is brilliant and keep you feeding bit by bits as the story go and keep entertaining through the whole gameplay i never been the biggest fan of turn based games with a few exceptions like xcom series but never imagined i will does a more action packed one the atmosphere combined with the music is just phenomenal its hard to describe when a cutscene perfecly match with breathtaking music or give weight to a hard fight and the most important part is the acting the actors did a brilliant job bringing life to the characters showing true emotions i cant wait for this studio to suprise us with another masterpiece btw i never seen another game in the past few years that worth the full price on release like e33,True,1760153807,3125,54

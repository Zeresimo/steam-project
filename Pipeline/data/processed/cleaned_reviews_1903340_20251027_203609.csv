1903340,extremely well made and fun normally i can't stand turn based gameplay but there's a couple things you can do on the enemies turn to counter it makes it interactive even when it's not your turn adding a level of skill to it compared to other turn based games that you have to eat the enemies attacks in this you can completely counter and get a attack out of it i'm not far into the game as of writing this review but so far the story is really fun and the combat looks really engaging with how much it gives you to work with definitely a one of a kind type of game,True,1761491292,689,4

1903340,definitely the goty 1010 superb indeed,True,1761486206,1366,2
1903340,this game is an achievement for this indie developer not only does it look immaculate but the characters are given such depth emotionally and mechanically the turn based combat is exciting as each character has different methods that make them more powerful and can provide synergies with other characters to make them even more powerful would highly recommend this game to any casual gamer that wants to play something beautiful with a stupendous score and turn based combat system,True,1761486106,3275,9
1903340,masterpiece,True,1761482751,2021,1
1903340,absolute cinema jrpg style turn based combat meets soulsstyle dodge and parry mechanics somehow it works awesome lots to explore and art direction is amazing some of the zones are a bit 'hemmed in' but there are so many secretsplatforming areas to explore that each one is unique and fresh definitely worth it at full price50 and on sale its a must buy,True,1761482475,1340,6
1903340,no character and place in game is real there saved you lamest twist possible most overhyped mediocre game lately art direction is boring melting locales that ai could generate terrible out of place music that really wants to be nierautomata score but with random instruments and genre changes that match nothing in game combat is just a rythimc game no strategy needed but still you will have to grind since bosses are damge sponges to force you to grind its popularity and almost unviersal acclaim as game of the year is crazy akin to mass histeria don't waste time and money on this,False,1761480802,423,5
1903340,for those who come after it's a good game with a mysterious world and a compelling story that keeps you invested however i do wish they would of considered putting some quality of life features into the game that tracked sidequests and a minimap to help with exploration having a minimap with fog of war only seeing what you've explored would have been immensely helpful in my journey preventing me from running around in circles expedition 33 is a straight forward turnbased rpg game that relies heavily on passive abilities you obtain from pictos which is essentially your gear in any other rpg you're gonna want to master every pictos you pick up as it allows for your entire party to use the passive abilities from these pictos without equipping them these passive abilities you obtain is how you are going to optimize your builds along with skills and weapon perks this results in struggle builds in the early game where it can be difficult to get an optimize build going because you have to constantly swap out pictos to master as you progress further into the game this will become less of a hassle i would call it a turnbased lite as the realtime mechanics requires the skill of dodging jumping parrying and qtes to survive encounters with not much tactical or strategical depth required to overcome most of its challenges there is no item management in this game you have panacealike potions that just cures all status effects without worrying about having antidotes eye drops phoenix downs and the likes also there is no positioning in this game no moving your party in the front or back to increase parry windows or attacks skills cost action points instead of mp and can regenerate rather quickly with the right passive abilities which encourages more aggressive play with that said this is a more welcoming and accessible turnbased rpg game for players who struggle to overcome the complexities and strategical nuances that most turnbased games have to offer clair obscur expedition 33 is a high recommendation,True,1761480460,1125,3
1903340,yes,True,1761478028,3010,3
1903340,1110 game stunning visuals gorgeous soundtrack and tonnes of feels my girlfriend watched me play this and said it's her favorite game ever i agree i will selfishly set other game studios who charge more to the standards of this game i will always be let down from now on you guys set the standard thank you so much for sharing this experience with me,True,1761477505,6012,1
1903340,i'm sad that i will only get the fresh experience of playing through this beautifully crafted world once the story is absolutely phenomenal the sound tracks are perfect the characters are deep and rich with personality the combat is so fresh the way the story paints different pictures of grief and all it's stages gives you such a vast look on life it's self this game is the standard we should be holding the gaming industry to because this will go down as one of the greatest games in the past decade,True,1761476398,1873,3

1903340,this game is without a doubt a masterpiece first i wasn't sure if i should play it as i honestly suck at games with counter mechanics but after watching the first 30 min of gameplay at my favorite streamer and ended up crying like a little kid i new i had to play it myself the world graphics combat voice actors and storytelling are all amazing the characters beautifully written i even ended up liking the combat system which i initially feared quickly getting better at dodging and parrying but i think most fights should be doable even if you can't avoid attacks well it works well with keyboard or controller the turn based system making strategic fighting possible the developers also included a story mode option which makes the fights a bit easier the music oh the music it's one of the best if not the best videogamesoundtrack i have heard till now this roller coaster has easily gotten a place in my top favorite games ever absolutely worth playing throw your money at them,True,1761471424,3724,140
1903340,this game is a masterpiece if you have not played or on the verge of wanting to play get it this game does everything correctly and would be a steal if it was double the price the gameplay is phenomenal the story is some of the best in gaming and i don't even need to say anything about the soundtrack as you've probably heard a part of it at least once in these past few months i played on expert and did not once consider anything unfair and not fun in conclusion get this game and buy it again so you can support the devs even more 1010,True,1761469845,2857,31
1903340,okay so i've bought this game a while ago after huge praise it got from everyone or rather after the hate it got from publications that were praising literal garbage and hating on this what ever those people don't like might actually be superb well after hearing the soundtrack on my steam deck and trying it out there for the first time that device is a true backlog murder machine i've decided to try it out on the big screen with more then 40 fps it is really not optimized well even on a 9070xt and yeah i came across the usual ue5 things like blurry shadows popins poor performance reliance on ai fake optimization and so on i then did the first tutorial fight an remembered people saying i can never do a normal turn based combat game ever again and rolled my eyes sure having qtes spices up the combat but it is not that important i will see what comes next i thought to myself but beating the mime at the harbor on the hardest difficulty only with skill rather then by overleveling is quite something though i have to admit it is not easy to put skill impression into turn based combat they managed it well this might not be that bad afterall after wandering around the city for 30 minutes and watching the true intro to this game i came here to make this review getting a tear out of someone after just that short amount of time is not easy although i have to admit that i am too in my 30s now and imagining that this could be the last thing that i ever do my last journey after losing my wife it hit home very strong what is there to hope for when facing a god like being that just wiped out thousands of people without even moving well i'll see,True,1761468620,85,174
1903340,h2 a great game h2 the story is the main not only though selling point it is as interesting as it is sad if i say more i would be soiling it for you i'll only say there is a lot of loss followed by grief the music needs an award go listen to it my only problem are the graphics unreal engine sometimes makes things look blurry or causes out of combat frame loss the gameplay is good if you like parrying there is an easy mode to extend the margin of error and or big numbers after buildcrafting exploration is often rewarded and the overworld opens up as you progress the main path is mostly linear but you can come back to any side areas sooner or later if you are struggling with one you'll be able to return there stronger no grind needed b tldr great game i guess france is good now b,True,1761468611,4736,1

1903340,when i heard about the hype of this game i was pretty skeptical it's pretty often that a new game comes out and the hype can bring my expectations up to an unrealistic standard that can be met yet somehow with the infinite hype this game met my expectations and shattered them this game is a loveletter to art to humanity's ability to always find love in places where you'd never expect it's not only a masterpiece as a game but as a work of art the gameplay is phenomenal it perfectly blends realtime action with the tactics of turnbased combat the exploration feels rewarding without being overbearing it's also gorgeous maybe one of the prettiest games of all time the art is so surreal and otherworldly while having impeccable attention to detail it's worth every word of hype it's been given 1010,True,1761462131,1923,25

1903340,everything you've heard about this game is accurate it really is that amazing from beginning to end that's not to say it has zero flaws as i definitely think the final portions of the game are a bit oddly paced there's some improvement that can also be made towards organizing your slots and abilities that you put into them for each character also could've used a map within each zone but that's a me thing as i get lost very easily and some areas were a bit difficult to navigate nothing i'm mentioning though takes away from the goty it is i believe it'll be considered classic 20 years from now i was also one of those people that would catch playthroughs on yt here and there and was skeptical about the hype to be honest it's just one of those games that you need to play yourself and don't let the turnbased element completely turn you off because it's not the way it's typically handled in other games you do take your turn to attackbuffetc but you still have to be on alert when the enemy or boss decides to try to hit you 5 times in a row and you need to either dodge or parry i'm terrible at both and would rage but it usually felt like i could win a battle if i tried hard and readjusted stuff i liked that i didn't really feel like i had to grind to proceed having said that it's worth looking around because it's a beautiful world with killer music and some incredible moments with some really amazing characters for the first time in a long time i felt really excited to play each time even after dying 5 billion times to the same boss i didn't look up anything because i just wanted to play it for however long i felt like it it was refreshing for those who come after i hope you enjoy it as much as i did it is something special,True,1761437045,3575,35

1903340,clair obscur is an okay game the story's solid though it sometimes feels like it needs more time to breathe the music is outrageously good especially lategame and the voice acting and spectacle are very well executed however the extremely player powersided balancing and reliance on dodgingparrying elaborate attack strings makes for very unsatisfying jrpg gameplay where you're either hyperoptimizing to cheese things and thus negating the action side of the game or playing more 'legit' and neglecting the rpg elements the game has a very weird difficulty curve thanks to this assuming you're making use of everything it gives you it starts out okay and quickly degenerates into a damage stacking festival there's also a general lack of polish in some areas like getting stuck on rocks while walking around or clipping through the floor or the fact that the campsite always looks pretty much the exact same regardless of where you camp overall though it's a good if somewhat overhyped game,True,1761407255,2368,30
1903340,i believe this has the best narrative and writing i've seen in years not just the main story but everything around you every little detail from just a sword sticking out of a enemys skull to the naming of characters relevance of the roses colors and art styles the little nods to how the the game is a way to show people that even in the world of mega corporations dominating the landscape in video games the team at sandfall who made their game with love and passion can pierce through and the game is also a nod for other inspiring indie devs for those who come after,True,1761407010,5137,24

1903340,overall 910 combat gets a bit repetitive but that's the case with all turn based games exploration is also a bit boring also the visuals are blurry which is just ue5's fault other than that music sound and story are all 1010,True,1761402126,735,6
1903340,for those who come after also to be real this game is an absolute masterpiece easy 1010 the risks this game and it's daring story takes pay off immensely and really capture the essence of what it is to be human and feel things so very deeply its got a great blend of rpg and action mechanics that mesh nearly perfectly the french cinema influence is so real in the best ways the characters are incredibly gripping and beautifully crafted and full of so many different layers for better and for worse and just the presentation and the art direction and the pacing and the boss battles and the intertwined mechanics are all so great and just ahhh i could talk for hours tbh and the music dear gods the music is incredible the sound design in general is perfect special shout out to the sound that plays when someone achieves a break but mannn lorien testard deserves all the accolades in the world for just how incredible the music is there's such a wide range of tracks that all perfectly fit their moments and encounters and have so much mastery in their construction on offer here even with a few minor issues and technical hiccups and a bit of jank and a few minigames that will forever bring me rage to think on it's never enough to truly detract from what was truly a classic in the making for something so well crafted to be sandfall's first project that everyone pulled their weight so much it's truly an accomplishment it's even the first game in a long time i went for 100 completion with bc it was that good please give this game a shot you wont regret it also also wish id played a little bit less at the time i dropped this bc i was so close to 333 hours on review rip,True,1761401581,2199,3
1903340,when final fantasy meets dark souls honestly it's a marvelous game and worth its money the thing i hate about this game and kind of is that it's a complete random that you cannot assume anything you don't know your combat numbers just 'big or small' wtf one foe hits 130 and same one but mostlikely of a higher level that you cannot see hits 2k randomly upgraded weapons and luminas and etc this is just a great fable to walk thru or master parry and play it,False,1761401470,1258,48

1903340,talking about expedition 33 wow i loved almost everything about this game music the soundtrack is phenomenal it's up there with my alltime favorites like xenoblade chronicles nier automata and final fantasy x expedition 33 has one of the best soundtracks i've heard in yearsit really sets the tone and elevates the experience combat the combat is a fantastic mix of turnbased mechanics with quicktime events active parrying and dodging as a fan of turnbased combat i see this as an evolution of the genre it feels dynamic and engaging i wasn't the biggest fan of the quicktime events for certain abilities but luckily you can turn them off if you prefer no complaints there characters the cast is absolutely funtastic each character is welldeveloped and their interactions feel natural and meaningful the conversations are mature and thoughtprovoking making you genuinely care about their journey story while i didn't love the story i still really enjoyed it act 1 had me completely hookedit was compelling and mysterious however after that things became a bit convoluted and my interest waned slightly that said the character moments throughout kept me engaged and there are still some great twists and turns for me act 1 was fantastic but the narrative lost a bit of steam after that final thoughts despite some minor narrative hiccups expedition 33 is easily one of the best games i've played in years it's definitely my game of the year so far and i can't recommend it enough rating 9510,True,1761386489,2242,7

1903340,h2confidence counts for a lot but not everythingh2 this is one of those titles that i appreciate more than i actually enjoy expedition 33 starts off as strong as any rpg i can think of the opening hours introduce a world and characters that are instantly captivating and you'll be totally on board and invested in the story by the time you see the title drop it's bold and confident in a way that's great to see from an indie studio combat is where we run into the first hitch i played through the entire game on expert because i'm a diehard fan of games like sekiro and nine sols parrybased defense systems with fast enemy attack patterns unfortunately coe33 mostly reinforces my love of those games by demonstrating what it's like when the gameplay isn't tuned to perfection parry windows are insanely tight but worse they're inconsistent some attacks hit on a sound cue others when the animation collides with your model others ibeforei the animation collides and some even iafteri it to the point where the parries sometimes have very little to do with the visual attack even worse the camera often puts other party members in the way or zooms out to a ridiculous degree that makes accurate timing nearly impossible enemies love to drag out and delay their swings like they're margit in molasses but because it's turnbased you can't do anything to punish them for it every attack is unique sometimes even from the same enemy which makes combat a neverending process of trial and error in better parry systems you can improve your core skill at the mechanic enough to take on new enemies and do wellbut here the first time you run into anything new you're almost guaranteed to have a few party wipes until you memorize their attack patterns and nohit them the coup de grce is the damage balancing up until the last 15 hours or so i never had access to gear pictos with good enough defensive stats to prevent even trash mobs from oneshotting most of my party members this means that a single mistake costs you a turn and a revivepar for the course in jrpgs but absolutely brutal when skipping a turn means having to sit through another attack string from the enemies some of which can have nearly a dozen hits in them don't play this on expert all that misery was mostly selfinflicted but a bigger issue is the story it's nearly impossible to discuss without spoilers but the plot plays its cards pretty early regarding some of its foundational mysteries and i couldn't believe they were actually doing it it felt like watching someone load up a bunch of foreshadowing shotgun shells pump the gun point it squarely down and blow their own foot off after that the narrative stakes are gone and remain utterly impossible to recover the final act of the game tries to rebuild tension but it just feels completely deflated i was shaking my head and going who cares during most of the late cutscenes the actual ending was fine and thematically appropriate but left me completely apathetic art and sound are also worth discussing the visual design is definitely a matter of taste but personally i didn't care for the look of the world at all after leaving the initial city it's going for a painterly aesthetic but to me most areas and enemies felt like messy blobs of melting goo the clashing biomes and stark colors are clearly intentional choices i just don't think they worked the soundtrack however constantly astounds with a variety of excellent instrumental electronic and choral tracks that blend together in a somehow cohesive whole genuinely the highlight of the game the vocal performances i played in english and cutscene motion capture were also excellent across the board now given the wildly negative review do i think you should play this i've gone back and forth on whether this is a recommend or not frankly despite its many many flaws it's the kind of game i want to see more of ambitious mature innovative and made with clear passion i'm glad it's seen so much critical success and gotten so much buzz i just didn't have a very good time iplayingi the actual thing but if nothing in this review is a total dealbreaker for you then i do think it's worth seeing for yourself whether or not you like it,True,1761365389,2910,24

1903340,is clair obscur a perfect game no there are a couple of things which stood out to me as negative the lip syncing and animations can be a little jank the story has some big plot twists that in my opinion didn't execute as well as the developers probably thought it would spoiler changing the main character halfway through the story did not help forcing us to play verso a character we barely knew right after gustave was a poor move yes verso's story is both tragic and integral to the plot but forcing us to play him felt a bit off spoiler the reason you should play co33 is because it's going to be unlike anything you've ever played in the best way possible it has its influences sure but the composition of the entire game is so original and artistically authentic that it stands out in a league of its own even if you're not thrilled by the concept of a turnbased jrpg you'll learn to love it if you approach it with an open mind i can say after completion that almost nothing i have ever played comes close to this it is a true artistic masterpiece crafted with lots of attention to detail and a concern for the player's enjoyment yes these developers set out to make sure you enjoyed this game it's not packed with bloated features or irrelevant side quests to get you to keep playing and for that reason they deserve all the praise and money in the world,True,1761361559,3891,1

you might exclaimbut seriously i'm on a trampoline herethe writing of the story and the main characters inside expedition 33 story are so well thought out that it needs to be experienced rather than being told for how fresh as a take it is how striking and impactful it is and how mature it presents itself to the public the dubbing adds so much more life and colour to what already was an intricate entanglement of plots and characters that it's almost embarrassing for higher end studios to not have this kind of will or care for the craft let's just tease you by saying that andy serkis has a big role in here the main point here is that e33 doesn't shy away whatsoever from depressing and grounded topics that could easily identify and define any of us playing the game some relatable experiences that are touched upon in here are just as mundane and heartbreaking as we can experience as human beings in our daily routines and yet it's also generous in giving you some relief from the cruelties and the inevitabilities of life b gameplay b it took us 26 years to witness another rpg implement a sort of quick time event skill based system after the legend of dragoon funded published and abandoned by sony back in 19992001 and it took us another 18 years to witness a compelling and mature story being part of a turnbased rpg as it was in lost odyssey as well ffx back in 2001 was also already pretty mature as a videogame and the first final fantasy with dubbed characters yet ff titles are generally received as more lighthearted novels back in 2007 so now we have this behemoth of a je'rpg yes you read it right redefining the mechanics and pretty much giving a fresh coat of depth that we as rpgjrpg fans didn't even knew we wanted giving us such a vast degree of freedom in creating classes and builds that for the genre i think it will go unmatched for quite some time did i already mentioned that you can potentially parry or dodge every attack that any enemy throws at you yeah well now i did so not only it gives you an insurmountable amount of content for party members to experiment with and passive points that let you create synergies between your weapons and your skills but it also tells you that if you git gud you can overcome every difficulty except maybe one fuckin fuck of a fucker eheeeeeh boi b soundtrack b the score in coe33 is just as fitting as you can imagine for the living people of the french nation with a couple of headbangers mixed inside a mostly orchestral soundtrack that sadly features a lot of french lyrics can you believe the guts on them for doing so as i've seen in a video covering the development of the game the composer was at his first project not even specifying if big or small just uliterallyu his first work ever on a videogame or production of some sort casually dropping a career defining collection of musical pieces and that's insane yeahi really don't know what to say no more so here's a bunch of french words to sooth your mind ibaguette croissant mon coeur sacre bleu tour de france parfum pomme de terrei and so many more don't get me started b graphicsart direction b as far as i'm concerned the visuals of this game are my only gripe because they both look very impressivebut also very terrible the lighting in the environment is managed pretty badly most of the times but it makes a full 360 twist when switching to a cutscene or while having a close up dialogue giving you a sense of inspiration being taken from the 40's well acquainted tasteful classy romantic voulez vous coucher avec moi french movie in an instant it has got brilliant cutscenes and facial expressions the enemies and inhabitants of the world that are not humanshaped are peculiar to say the least but also very charming esquie is a brilliant example of this and i kinda love it because it doesn't remind me of anything in particular and it feels like it was purposely painted for this game the world building is generous and fulfilling without going on forever which is a plus for me presenting a decent variety between scenarios h2 it is pretty i clair i that this expedition is i obscur33i h2 clair obscur expedition 33 is a complete work of art that checks a lot of boxes for me made by a dedicated production of very well passionate individuals making the most of their experience and it's a remarkable achievement for me personally to look at this game to think that it's actually holding up despite the limitations it had and the fierce competition that could have easily outshined this project if it was more focused on making games for the fun of it instead of being led by petty monetary gain in the end the good aspects completely nullify some technical and graphical artifacts that the unreal engine 5 managed to bring over with that said i'm giving clair obscur expedition 33 10 very soft and fluffy on the inside but solid and crunchy on the outside freshly baked baguettes out of 10 which is the highest possible rating in france enjoy while it's fresh,True,1761324165,5137,16

1903340,amazing game could not put it down for days and always felt like there was another mystery to uncover as the story progressed the characters felt like real people dialogue felt fluid and natural and the ending tore me in two with the final decision one of the only times i will give props to the french for great quality work,True,1761323081,2940,1

1903340,this game reminded this 36 year old why i love playing games it has a wonderfully immersive world that is beautiful the development is well thought through the combat is balanced well i found myself with new techniques right up until the end the story had me in tears at the end as a gamer dad it can be hard to find time to game but i made the time to ensure i finished this one congrats to the developers at sandfall for making a game that is amazing,True,1761321017,3234,1
1903340,this is one of the best games i have ever played an absolute masterpiece in art combat and music my only criticism being that i can't go into it blind again like i did the first time games don't usually stick with me to the extent that clair obscur has and i am extremely happy that i gave it a try,True,1761318165,2626,2
1903340,i'll be surprised if it is not game of the year for a small studio to put out a game this emotional and good looking at the same time the timings take a while to learn but once you have it my how flashy,True,1761317914,1454,8
1903340,not groundbreaking but i quite enjoyed it good plot twists though the storytelling and character exposition feels clunky imo but acceptable it's definitely not goty as many might say here there are fricking kcd2 and ds2 this year what goty are you talking about i even got interested in this game because some called it a goty lol come on i finished 100 of the game but still i did not find a good competition to kcd2 though i can agree that clar obscur expedition 33 is superior in artwork it basicallly has more artistic freedom plotwise but the game pales in comparison in other art directions ie cinematography in conclusion i expected way more from this based on all the talks but putting it all aside i definitely enjoyed it for what it offers i even 100ed it though not goty but it represents jrpg genre very well system recommendations ran it on r5 7600x 16gb ddr5 rtx3080ti and sata ssd i still used dlss a little like 75 was raw raster because 1 location stone wave cliffs i believe was running with low fps felt like a bit under 30 but otherwise there was no complaint for a 100 run,True,1761317518,7032,1
1903340,really enjoying the game so far as someone who isn't the biggest fan of turn based rpg games i can see why expedition 33 is getting a lot of praise and would recommend this game to anyone who was thinking about playing it,True,1761317504,384,7
1903340,honestly there's so much positive you could say about this game from the music to the playable areas to the love and care put into the story and each character or how great the combat feels but i'll keep it short with over 65 hours invested into my first playthrough just made it into act 3 and having stayed entirely spoiler free prior to playing i feel like this game's hype didnt live up to how good the game actually is when you actually sit down soak in the atmosphere of the music and environment and just experience it highly recommend for anyone out there that's never given it a chance easily exceeds the value you pay for the game 1110 fantastic experience amazing game,True,1761316630,4440,5

1903340,game of the year quality for sure its been a while since i've played a game that had me fiending to play when out and about cannot recommend enough,True,1761308349,4156,1
1903340,minor spoilers it takes a really special piece of media for me to listenwatchplay for an extended period of time i can never find myself enjoying sitting down and consuming a single piece of media for too long i don't really know how i got to this point maybe i have addled my brain with too much time spent watching short form content that my attention span has been reduced to nothing maybe it's that i am getting older and have less time after work to indulge in such pleasures for example i play a match of war thunder die within 1 minute into the match i still have reserve vehicles which i can continue playing but i find myself just altf4'ing and going onto another game conversely i could have just finished a 4060 minute dota 2 match clawing our way back from near defeat all the way to assured victory and destroying the enemy team so even though i would be riding that sweet dopamine ride of victory i very rarely would think to myself and say yes another instead i'll quit and move onto the next game play for a bit and either get bored or frustrated then move on to the next game rinse and repeat even when i play with friends i find the longer i play a game with them the more i start to want to play another game and that makes the current game feel like it is dragging me down i know that sounds dumb but i guess that is just how my brain works which means for me at least any media that makes me want to play longer is truly special in my eyes and that is the case with clair obscur expedition 33 there was a lot of talk about how good this game was since launch how critics are claiming this is a goty contender from the very moment it burst onto the market and in an era of aaa publishers pushing half baked bug infested games to market and fixing them after launch clair obscur was a breath of fresh air now i am by no means a critic i leave such detailed analysis to my brother who is far more experienced in delving into the intricacies of what separates the good media to consume from the bad he quite often recommends pieces of media he thinks i would enjoy and despite how stubborn i can be to listen to him he is right 99 of the time my brother didn't need to convince me to play clair obscur there were many things that drew me into wanting to play this game the social media hype the critical acclaim the art design the gameplay the fact i got a new pc and wanted it to flex its muscle on games at ultra quality at 1440p but what actually did it for me is that i'm a sucker for sound tracks i don't know how sandfall interactive did it but they managed to get a composer who has never done work on video games before and say fuck it and produce 150 tracks for this game all of them are great tracks some are even amazing tracks a few are absolutely certified bangers a truly astonishing feat for a western game and lorien testard should receive all the praise he deserves which coming from a kiwi is saying something iykyk the sound track along with the performances from the voice actors made me find myself constantly and consistently getting shivers right as the moment hits during the cut scene two in particular lumire and une vie t'aimer shine out lumire being what in my eyes or ears in this case is the leitmotif for the whole game the constant call backs and subtle changes to it you hear throughout the game make this piece a central part to the story and the main track by itself is just an actual masterpiece alice duportpercier's voice is immaculate and i now constantly find myself humming dim dim dah da di dim dim dah all the time now as a result but then there is une vie t'aimer when it comes to video game music there is a certain song from a certain jrpg that is universally praised by all so when people call this song the french one winged angel it just shows you how fucking hard this song goes this is how you make music for boss fights i can't remember the last time playing a game and just completely enthralled the music a song that has both a male and female vocalist absolutely going at it is a perfect metaphor for the game which if you know the story you would realise how seriously poetic this along with the other vocalised soundtracks are the sound track is just chefs kiss overall and if it doesn't win best sound track of the year somebody needs to see what kind of drugs geoff keighley is taking now finally the game play i am still not sure if clair obscur is technically a jrpg but whatever it is it is basically the western equivalent of it either way i am no stranger to jrpg's and souls like games i have been a fan of pokemon since i was 7 and i have begrudgingly played through the dark souls trilogy and still have my sanity although soulslike games aren't my go to style of game i am definitely not opposed to them but playing this game just hits different each playable character's play style is so unique and trying to find those perfect synergies with each other was really fun to finally hone in on and then satisfying to watch as you pummel the enemies into oblivion their move sets are flashy are great to watch and the quick time events to use the moves keeps you just as engaged using the moves as you are when trying to dodge the enemies moves overall game design and world building figuratively and literally a work of art no two game levels ever feel the same and it was fun to explore them fully and finding those little secret areas of the level that gave rewards via lore drops or new items the world map is fun to navigate i like seeing inaccessible parts in beginning areas as that gets you back tracking once you progress further in the story to find those hidden goodies that were tantalisingly out of reach just before the game loop is fresh there are a wide range of enemies that all have unique move sets and that feeling of facing the unknown when it comes to a new enemy happens fairly often not knowing the timings on the dodges can be real nerve racking to get down right and frustrating when you don't in a good way there were always those mini bosses you can face special chroma versions of enemies you can find that are far tougher to beat they often expand on the regular version's move sets which can catch you out especially if you aren't expecting a 4th or 5th hit in what is normally a 3 hit combo for the standard version of the enemy the main group of characters each have their charm and touching backstory that really makes you invested in their outcome playing through the prologue you really understand what they are all fighting for each year everyone of a certain age effectively gets thanos snapped and your expedition so full of hope is determined to put an end to it which seeing what happens at the start and end of act 1 a real fucking heart breaker the expedition starts off landing right into an ambush and all but the playable characters survive and then at the end of act 1 you have who you think is the main character just get fucking owned in fact the ending cut scenes of both act 1 and act 2 left me lost for words both story events that happened really turned everything i thought i knew about the story and how i thought it was going to play out in its head it really showed that this game was gonna take you for a ride emotionally in a good way and made me really invested in the story to see what came next i do hope they make a sequel or at the very least a dlc i still haven't fully finished the game just the main story so i am looking forward to jumping back in to see what parts i missed and more importantly see how much damage i can get maelle to do 1010 game,True,1761305939,2650,9

1903340,overall great game the main selling points of the game are the great storyvisualsost and the combat from a story perspective it gave me vibes of nier automata i enjoyed expedition 33 more from a gameplay perspective this is like paper mario or super mario rpg with the turnbasedactive combat system great music great visuals great story and great characters i like how the full team can be used if your main team dies in combat you can bring in the remaining members to win the fight item usage is good refreshes at checkpoints so no need to stockpile healing items throughout the playthrough stable no real crashes all characters feel balanced in combat and i enjoyed playing and leveling everyone up throughout my playthroughs the pacing near the end of the game around final act is confusing i suggest once you get to this act where everything opens up you should resist the urge to do all optional content before facing the final boss and just go straight to the boss you can go back and complete the side content afterwards without any issue the relationship system breaks me out of immersion a bit i wish it just naturally happened instead of being something you opt into,True,1761267133,5326,11
1903340,best game ever made,True,1761266711,3896,1
1903340,this game is artistically beautiful between the music visuals and cutscenes it's easy to see why people can be so captivated with its presentation i've seen many people calling this game a masterpiece and it's a little hard to argue otherwise the positives certainly outweigh the negatives but i don't think that means this game is without fault either one thing i will mention is that i think that while the level design is beautiful it is also kind of a hassle to navigate every area has dozens of deadends with loot to be found or minibosses to fight most of which aren't too important but then sometimes you'll miss energizing start 2 find energizing start 3 later and realize you missed an incredibly important staple item and have to go backtrack to get it you might have scenarios like this happen to you multiple times throughout the game it's annoying that aside the rpg combat might be what i'm most conflicted by i played this game on expert up until the final boss of act 2 where i finally got tired of this game's reliance on parry mechanics this game really showcases the negatives of the parrification of modern games where attacks are intentionally designed to be misleading just to increase the difficulty of parrying successfully i love how unique each character is and there is a lot of customization available for each character and how you want to play them however since parrying is what generates the most ap the flow of the game is greatly hampered if you aren't parrying most attacks that come your way to the game's defense there are ways to generate more ap by simply facetanking everything but expert mode's damage is so high that it's very difficult to get to that point overall i found the gameplay to be the weakest part of this game and it's entirely due to the enemy design the story is pretty good and has a good amount of depth and i think the primary antagonist is incredibly well written i won't go into much detail about acts 1 and 2 but the game is able to flip between charming and funny moments while maintaining a constant undertone of melancholy going full into act 3 spoilers but spoiler the ending left me feeling conflicted and i think the reason stems from the decision to let the player choose between two endings this is a deeply personal story of the grief of verso's family and it feels very weird that you the player who had no input in the story up until this point make a binary choice to decide their fate either maelle stays in her fictional painted world or verso is finally put to rest allowing the family to come together again to grieve i dislike the decision to force a final fight between these two because of what it means for the one you didn't choose either verso is effectively a prisoner to maelle who cannot let go of the past or verso pushes maelle away without convincing her to finally let go both options feel like a poor resolution for the other party and i would have preferred a single ending where the two can come together and accept whatever the final outcome is spoiler i think this is absolutely a game worth giving a play and i'm glad to have finished it,True,1761265982,2506,15

1903340,best video game i've played in my life everything about it story visual design gameplay etc is either great or brilliant but the absolute highlight is the immaculate soundtrack the only criticism i can think of is that there isn't more of it namely act 3 could be longer and give some of the characters i liked the most real renoir clea more screentime,True,1761258888,2726,1
1903340,this game is one of the biggest rollercoasters of emotions i have seen this is the goty there is so much going on i just the game brings up very hard choices not in a black and white matter but in a perfect grayest moral area i rarely see such a thing to be made in a proper light this is the work of art and not a game the audio the visuals the combat system everything is so satisfying and the volume of tears i have produced have probably made me dehydrated 1110 just 1110,True,1761258609,1873,14
1903340,what a game a truly fantastic and unique story as it unfolds so does combat mechanics with easy to learn hard to master with the twist of the player itself being responsible for the dodge which creates a more interactive game as well as giving the player more agency where mistakes are on you no some chance procentage and i love it i think most can quickly recognize this game as being quite beatiful with its very artistic style with the only major downside here being that it was made with ue5 however i think the characters themselves shouldn't be overlooked either as they each have their values and goals explored throughtout the story also in a quite natural way the soundtrack is rarely something i focus on with games unless of course it is a rythem game but i have quite a few songs from this game now saved to my spotify playlist conclusion these 3 pillars are what in my opinion can make this the game of year on another note i also quite admire that none of the achievements have less than 10 this could possibly be statistical evidence to suggest that most people truly enjoyed this game as some of these are from relatively hard optionel boss fights a few negatives some of the gestral games minigames are a bit janky and feels quite unpolished compared to the main game ue5 with regard to performance and presentation of the game itself a playable characterv later in the game with a central role in the story feels quite boring compared to the others a few additional positves the equipment system and pictos were a bit of a mystery for me at the beginning but i figured it out somewhere along the way and quite like it as well every character is unique in their fighting style but can also be a bit overwhelming i must admit it was first later in the game that i wanted to try and understand one of the companions fighting style but this is a postive as it adds variety to the gameplay,True,1761257006,5124,8

1903340,clair obscur is an incredible game with an indepth complicated story if you finish it the story will keep you in the dark for 90 of the playthrough which in my opinion is a poor flaw in the writing you won't understand what is happening until 15 hours into the game they give small hints here and there but nothing that will allow you to understand the overall grandiose plot once the plot is finally revealed everything instantly becomes better and more enjoyable it just a shame that it takes so long to understand personally the game was a struggle to continue forward with and i would have stopped if it wasn't for the hype that surrounded it the combat system of turnbased isn't my favorite although they did make it interesting with it's complexity that i honestly didn't fully understand there is so much love and time that was put into clair obscur and it shows that the gaming industry isn't dead when you have a small team that is passionate about their work this is what it produces this game is worth the money and honestly deserves to be game of the year,True,1761237889,1242,35

1903340,incredible game changed my views on the french 910 beacuse it could've been even better in a few places by far the best part of this game are the characters the game just makees you really care for them and you yourself want to see them succeed they all are just amazing and honestly i wish they did more stuff with em lune sciel lose plot relevence after about halfway through act 2 and monoco doesn't really have much stuff do to overall fortunately the side quests and camp interactions help it a bit but i really wish they had more plot relevence beacuse as i said after beating about 60 of the game the main plot focuses on maelle and verso which is done amazingly for the record the story overall is so fucking good like bro ah it makes you think about it for days but i don't want to spoil you too much i really loved finding the journals of previous expeditions and their flags just learning what our predecesors did is really nice unfortunately the game fails a bit in this regard the enviornmental story telling would have been a lot better imo if the bodies we find would have the corresponding numbers on their bands they do have em in cutscenes but normally they're just empty so every body we find looks about the same it's not much of an issue really but would have been an amazing detail another great thing is the combat i've played many jrpgs over the years and this game probably has one of the best there is just amazing and satysfying honestly thank god this game is turnbased beacuse the hitboxes are terrible lmao what does that mean well basically in the overworld you can find nooks and crannies which you think you can enter but oops invisible wall you have an attack to get an advantage in fights but it's hitboxes are ass it's hitboxes is about 23 of the size of the attacks animation and the parkour oh god the parkour there aren't many parkouring segments so it's not really that big of a deal but the grabbing ledges mechanic doesn't work correctly i think especially during exploration you often have to walk around to get somewhere even tho in theory your character should be able to grab the ledge it often gets a bit frustrating when you find those gestral challanges where you have to pray the character will grab onto the ledge and not bounce off of it jumping isn't good overall beacuse you lose control of your character mid air and after you hit the ground your character does a roll which you can't stop you can turn mid air to affect the way where your character will go aftere dropping but it's pretty janky the music tho guys the music is soooo gews mmmm i forgot to talk about the locations they're awesome the setting is really cool and what happens in it is just so magical sorry if this review seems too negative i really love this game and it's just almost perfect the gestral challanges aren't even that hard for the record and there's not much platforming in this game so it's not really an issue but when it is it's not good for those who come after silksong better tho 3,True,1761224891,5219,29

1903340,pretty good game overall really liked the story and the combat is very active and fun for a turnbased game very pretty with awesome music very little to complain about the difficulty was a little weird for me first off when it tells you that mastering parrydodge is helpful but not mandatory for normal difficulty they are absolutely lying if you don't hit the majority of your parries you will die a lot it is doable but i found it tedious so i ended up dropping it down to easy but that was way too easy damage dropped down to about 110 what i was taking in normal every semblance of challenge was gone i'll take a too easy game over too hard tedious but i really would have liked a setting in between the two also act 3 i did what it told me to do and the game ended took like an hour or two maybe there's a bunch of optional stuff out there that didn't really get hinted at but as far as mandatory content it could've just been stuck at the end of act 2,True,1761192734,1409,128

1903340,this game completely revived turnbased combat for me the parry and dodge system feels unique for tbc and it's easily one of the best games out there when it comes to character builds you can turn any character into an absolute powerhouse there's a ton of endgame content and even a new game mode to keep you hooked the story captures the spirit of classic jrpgs with some truly amazing plot twists some you might see coming and others that will completely catch you off guard the characters are all lovable and funny supported by some of the best voice acting i've ever heard in a game the animations are impressively lifelike and fluid avoiding the stiffness that npcs have in so many titles the world itself is massive and artistic like exploring a living painting can't wait for a sequel,True,1761187649,4374,12

1903340,just finished clair obscur expedition 33 with my play style it took me slightly under a hundred hours to complete the game on steam it has an overwhelmingly positive rating the highest possible and i have to say that the game more than lives up to that rating if you love a characterdriven story with emotion and heart this game dives deeply into complex characters and their evolving relationships twists and turns in the story carry emotional weight of heroism and heartache the composition of the music is exceptional and deeply emotionally moving using classical instruments and sonorous female vocals the artist is exceptional with the wonderfully vivid imaginations of the developers bringing the world to life in and wondrously immersive way if you're looking for something to add to your list of games to play i would highly recommend this one although i'll give no spoilers as that would cheat you of the innocent wonder of playing this game without any preconceptions,True,1761185268,5713,9

1903340,very good story twists turns and some very interesting concepts enjoyable turn based combat that keeps things active so it feels a lot better than the dusty old turn based jrpg approach the only bad thing i can say about the game is that sometimes trying to grab a ledge just doesn't work for whatever reason and during some of the parkour stuff it makes you want to rip your hair out other than that it's amazing there is a reason this is everyone's game of the year it is actually that good if you are questioning it just get it definitely worth it,True,1761171751,3336,50

1903340,what happens when you experience the tragedy of innevitability clair obscur expedition 33 is a game that has been rightly hyped up not only is the game beautiful not only is the game play fast paced and frenetic while also having deep tactics and not only does the game have one of the most amazing soundtracks of the decade it also has a story that is far deeper and emotionally evocative than you could believe clair obscur is a game that is difficult to talk about because there's almost nothing to say that won't spoil moments from the story that are worth experiencing for yourself to put things simply this is a masterpiece of a game it's fun it looks amazing it sounds amazing it's written fantastically it manages to have the proper amount of tonal shifts to keep you engaged and not make you numb to the story beats and the game is going to ask you to make decisions that don't have perfect outcomes the only thing that this game has issues with is the ultimate boss you can choose to fight that is so difficult compared the rest of the game that it essentially requires you to create a kind of cheat build to accomplish i just recommend avoiding it because it doesn't add anything of value to the story in addition i recommend that you complete the game prior to doing optional side content as the game is really set up with this expectation in mind i completed the game after doing all the side content and it was so easy that even after setting the final boss to 100x health turning off healing and getting rid of some of my better abilities the final boss was too easy so do that before you do the side content to get the best end game experience,True,1761162915,3329,135

1903340,it started out great a dark gritty storyline nice music and art the voice acting and writing is pretty good then suddenly you meet goofy living paintbrushes and engage in boxing matches and platforming challenges to win swimsuit outfits bad dudes whose only explanation and motive apparently is that killing you is saving you the trouble of dying which is lazy as fuck writing it lost me midway through act 2 or whenever it was when i lost one of the characters and clone replacement 2 stepped right in the combat is all right i liked the cards system maybe but i never got any really great builds figured out so every battle was mostly using roughly the same tactic over and over and it started to get boring 6510 i'll give it a thumbs up because i think many other people will like it but i need more from a narrative journey and the tactical combat just wasn't picking up the slack,True,1761091513,1036,226
1903340,for what it is it's a masterpiece people will call it turn based dark souls and it really is fair to say different here and there yeah sure obviously but it's turn based and yet you kinda need to be active at all times to parry and dodge because of this i'd note that this game is just flat out not going to be for everyone it takes a certain kind of mentality to enjoy and i'm not going to argue with someone who found it difficult or annoying for a lot of people it will be but if anything about this game appeals to you at all you'll probably see why people love it,True,1761091189,4863,2

1903340,opening is insane despite only 15 min into the game i got somehow attached to these characters and got me emotional deep inside for those who love turnbased jrpg to my millennial bros and sis this game is for us what makes this even better is the parry and dodge mechanics there's a realtime defensive mechanics that rewards players when reacting to enemy patterns correctly dozens of optional bosses and locations with god like rewards it doesn't feel repetitive 1010 ost especially the une vie t'aimer stun locks players on the first few sec une vie peindre is also good my goodness in my opinion the length of this game is just perfect not too long but definitely not short story i got a mix reaction for this act 1 and act 2 is awesome but before going to act 3 that's where i got to say eh what the heck is this story this is stupid then after finishing this story bravo absolute cinema 1010 even side stories are great and finally growing up and having a family games now just don't hit the same anymore like they used to until i play and finish this game i don't usually do this stuff but i beat this game on ps5 out of respect for making me feel something again on video games i brought this game here on steam this is definitely my game of the year,True,1761088685,1095,2

1903340,this game as you may already know is a masterpiece the storytelling as well as boss battles are breathtaking the difficulty levels are also well made it has 3 levels history which as the name suggest let you play the game without worrying much about the battles expedition which is demanding some skills and may even request you to redo a boss fight 35 times expert where you do 0 dmg and are one shotted by everything if someone would force me to say something negative about the game i would say it's a turn based game which is not for everyone,True,1761084235,3520,18

1903340,personal goty 2025 and so refreshing to see a rly new and unique ipnew story game srsly game is not short but if the main story was at least twice as long it would have been a perfect game also a great example of what aaa games should be full game in the base game no cashgrab mandatory storyside quest dlcs while still offering additional dlcs that u can get to support the devs and honestly i never have anything against additional skins artwork or soundtrack dlcs turn based combat done perfectly srsly parry perf parry evade jump and gradient counter just amazing every char has their unique fighting style and skills and this is done soooooo great i loved it its rly amazing as whoever u put in the party u always have 3 chars with very different yet compatible playstyle even tho some might not sit with u at first after a few fightsskill unlocks u will like all charsstyles i rly like all of them even tho i might pref some more but didn't dislike any of them very nice difficulty til mid act 1 its 2 easy yes but gets nicely challenging after it i legit had parts where i put all 3 or 45 out of 6 points into defense lol great interesting story altho personally i didn't like every twistthing you find out in the world they build great gameplay loop be it longer story cutscenes multiple battles before i leave the current area and exploring whatever area i was in rly trying to find all secrets and beat all enemies found great chars altho kinda dislike some of gustaves early post tutorial decisionsthoughts beautiful map and locations u can see a lot of love was put into every single corner exploring is always rewarded except if u ignore and enter a danger zone on the main map 2 early in which case ur fckd and every corner has something for you to find nice optional puzzlesfun challenges decent length depending on ur skill i'd say 2530h to finish the main story and yeah playin on easy doesn't count as playing honestly wish the main story was at least 50h long end game content kinda feel like end game content is 40 of the whole game game like this should have rly been longer in the way that it had a lot more game before the finale and before the end game content i rly wish they expanded the story further and put most of the endgame content into the main story before the finale they rly had few bigger story points that they could have resolved separately with that once i beat the game i kinda lost part of the interest as there was no purpose in doing the end game stuff yes post end content is mostly rly fun but some felt like a chore as u needed to lv up to be able to do it without 10h long battles where u must evade almost everything even tho i rly wanted to beat it all and enjoy the adventure i felt less motivated to do so after seeing the ending i even was thinking of trying the danger areas before the finale as i somehow wanted to have the side content done before the finale additional skinshairstyles to find sadly most of the skinshairstyles are the same across ie u unlock ponytail for lune which looks exaclty like maelle's and u will 99 unlock the same ponytail for ciel later only difference is the hair color xd honestly wouldn't even say this is a con if we had more uniquer looking skins and hairs to find even if some or most were still shared then 910 for me,True,1761065373,2705,160

1903340,for those who come after,True,1761062091,5687,10
1903340,the game that first got me into rpgs was the legend of dragoon and i was instantly reminded of that combat style when i saw a preview of expedition 33 although the combat style is similar it's definitely not the same as the timing button presses go with abilities in this whereas they went with regular attacks in legend of dragoon my gripe with the timing of this game is that they seem to be random as oppose to going with the movement of the character during the ability cast the combat is quite a bit more complex with luminas and the ability to equip more passively and weapon passives that can completely change how a character plays aside from just simply choosing other abilities to use in combat this game feels almost like a blend of a jrpg with dark souls with very frequent boss fights and irregular attack patterns from enemies frequent boss fights there are sometimes two or three in a row which i'm not a huge fan of personally i prefer the more jrpg approach of building up to a boss and having them less frequent irregular attack patterns the game has 3 ways to deal with enemy attacks parry dodge and jump at the beginning of the game dodging seems pretty useless since it's like a parry but no counter attack but later on you find out there are specific attacks that necessitate a dodge i'm a huge fan of this variety in button timing for defence what i don't like is how the timing of the button push is right before the attack and not the timing of when the attack hits you so that throws off my timing every now and then in addition enemies sometimes do feign attacks or weird movements so you might parrydodge unnecessarily which is fine but a lot of fights are less about timing skill and more about memorising the attack patterns meaning i highly doubt you can play this game in 1 playthrough without getting hit obviously without a guide too all in all this is a great game with nice graphics fantastic music fun side quests and a great story it doesn't quite scratch that legend of dragoon itch for me though i acknowledge it's its own game and should be considered as such i still highly recommend it for turnbased rpg fans,True,1761061455,2432,16

1903340,clair obscur is a story that often captivates with its atmosphere and thematic depth here's a breakdown plus points strengths atmospheric storytelling the story excels in creating a specific mood often utilizing vivid descriptions and sensory details this can draw the reader into the world and enhance their emotional connection to the narrative thematic exploration clair obscur frequently delves into complex themes such as identity memory loss and the nature of reality this can provide readers with plenty to contemplate and discuss character development the characters are often welldeveloped with internal conflicts and growth that resonate with readers their relationships and interactions can be a significant draw unique narrative structure the story might employ an unconventional narrative structure such as flashbacks multiple perspectives or fragmented timelines which can add intrigue and keep the reader engaged symbolism and imagery the use of symbolism and evocative imagery enriches the story providing layers of meaning and encouraging deeper interpretation minus points weaknesses pacing issues the story might suffer from pacing problems with sections that feel slow or drag on potentially losing the reader's interest vagueness and ambiguity while thematic depth is a strength excessive vagueness can be frustrating if the story is too abstract or unclear it may alienate some readers character flaws while complex characters are good if the characters' actions or motivations aren't believable it can undermine the narrative unresolved plotlines the story might leave certain plot threads or questions unanswered which can be unsatisfying for readers who prefer a sense of closure overreliance on style sometimes the focus on style and atmosphere can overshadow the plot or character development leaving the story feeling superficial,True,1761006901,4446,71

1903340,this game is seriously beautiful the art is wild and nothing like most games out there it feels surreal like you're walking through a dream that makes no sense but somehow keeps pulling you in honestly it's both amazing and a little messed up i kept thinking whoever made this world must've been in a strange headspace the world itself is huge and gorgeous but i got lost constantly i walked in circles more times than i can countremember this game needs a minimap or at least something to help guide you half the time i had no clue where i was going but somehow i still found the next area lol the story starts off super depressing so if you're already feeling down maybe wait to play this one it does get better later but it stays pretty gloomy all the way through certainly not my type some bosses and elite enemies are insanely tough but if you enjoy challenges you'll love it it actually feels rewarding when you finally beat them there are so many skills and pictons to pick from it's a lot to figure out but fun to mess with the music is incredible with legit highquality classical tracks some are dark some are light and all of them fit perfectly you can tell they put a lot of effort into it i haven't finished exploring everything yet and honestly i'm not sure i ever will but this game is one of the most unique things i've played confusing beautiful emotional and completely different huge respect to the devs for creating something this bold,True,1761004483,2150,4
1903340,exceptional game from the the very start the visuals caught my attention there where moments where i would just stand in one spot mesmerized by the sheer beauty of the landscape not to mention the ost made me tear up at certain points the game play itself was very addicting i would stay up all night grinding and learning the patterns of the enemies not only that but the complex nature of the game with its pictos and lumina system made things very interesting as i would spent hours testing new combos and builds my only grip with the game is that the ui seemed kinda messy and hard to uderstandsee when first playing the game and the gestral games where kinda clunky but other than that fantastic game 1010,True,1761004285,5776,1

1903340,good game overall however one particular aspect absolutely destroyed my capacity to enjoy the game the 'genius' game writers decided it would be a good idea to kill of your main character during the main story character who i also found to be the most likeable one in the game i am not kidding your main character that you become attached to dies scripted story death and cannot be recovered from that point on it is replaced by an extremely obnoxious fellow that becomes your main this is not even funny i honestly pretty much stopped playing the game after that point if i wanted to watch promising scifi drama with a retarded ending i would go and watch game of thrones or wheel of time again but i won't just like i won't come back to playing this game why is modern story writing in general so utterly trash from games to tv series i wonder if the story writers actually receive directives about what to write and are forced to include various 'societal trends' in their scenarios so that they can 'train' the population to behave certain ways which basically interferes with their talent and leads to stupidly bad scenarios,False,1760974717,3978,6

1903340,hands down the best rpg i have played since ffviii was a new release as a fan of rpgs in general and notable entries being ffviii legend of the dragoon and the last remnant i mean to say this might be the best of all time the battle mechanics are new and fresh and have an actual learning curve you can customize your style and even minmax to your hearts content this is a true turn based system with an active component that is configurable to your desire to either set and forget or to require additional inputs for max damage the story is beautiful funny and painful all at once it keeps you guessing if you are the type to try and figure out what is happening with the world if instead you are the kind to let it unfold it keeps you engaged while most games in recent history i would play while listening to music or an audio book i was unable to with this game as the score was alluring and audio clues enhance the experience finally the game leaves you wanting more of everything there are battles that require you to squeeze every last drop out of your characters to the point that they become broken or rather broken in a different way lol and 100 the game is difficult but not tedious there is lore that you must chase but the world is so interesting that i cant wait for the next entry into the series while most things are spelled out some of the lore must be teased from between the proverbial lines and there are easter eggs hidden by the dev's that are not blatant but certainly intriguing when you grasp their meaning the character development makes you feel for the people and the implications of certain story line elements wrench your heart around overall what an excellent game for those who come after,True,1760946239,6656,1

1903340,everything you've heard about this game is true i went in almost entirely blind after this flew under my radar and i can pretty confidently say this is now my personal favorite game period it's really crazy that a game this perfect can release in the modern industry landscape gorgeous graphics with unique and longevous art direction optimized so well that my almost 5 year old computer can run it without issue weighty satisfying turnbased combat that starts simple but becomes complex and customizable the deeper into the game you get even if endgame builds are largely oneshot based an unbelievable soundtrack that is going to dominate my playlist until this time next year the writing and characters deserve their own praise for not only being vivid and extensively fleshed out but also real with palpable flaws and realistic reactions todepictions of things like grief and anxiety i gaze longingly at party members 4 and 5 there's so much information you can infer about them and their mindsets just from watching them talk as you playit's entrancing the central themes those being grief and escapism are very relatable and very relevant both to the party and pretty much every character in some way shape or form with this in mind the way more lighthearted and comedic moments were presented to break the tension had me giggling out loud i was laughing out loud one minute and on the verge of tears the next this games ending is like a million daggers in your heart in the best way possible and it might be controversial to say but i really enjoyed it probably the only complaint i have about the game as a whole is that i'd have appreciated a minimap for some areas i glare directly at the gestral village and that once your power spikes after getting those two pictos you can pretty much curbstomp everything left in the game bar the hardest superboss hype as shit btw the commentary and philosophies this game presents are genuinely incredibly engaging and in case you forgot after all that yapping there's a fucking masterpiece of a video game attached to it as of writing i've defeated every superboss again hype as shit and collected every achievement and never once did it feel like a chore if you have even a vague interest in turnbased combat themes of mourning and loss or even art as a whole for the love of god play this game you will not regret it tomorrow comes,True,1760940607,3346,3

1903340,there's no universe where this game could have anything bad about it the last time i played a turnbased rpg was pokmon leaf green over ten years ago and i thought i'd drop this one after a few hours surprise i ended up finding one of the best gameplay experiences soundtracks worlds and stories i've seen in years you can really tell what's possible when there isn't some clueless client behind a giant company telling you what you can and can't do for me it's hands down my goty for 2025 sorry silksong i still love you,True,1760933658,1935,1

1903340,a masterpiece of a game released in 2025 with a nostalgic turnbased combat system with a very unexpected twist of this time forcing you to engage in the otherwise mundane combat system and many mechanics that were present in classic titles like final fantasy the game has not failed to evoke nostalgia factors constantly for me an amazing story written that is not too short and not too long with plenty of twists that gets you hooked the game is also kind enough to allow you to finish the game with minimal grind and has a difficulty setting which reduces damage to mere 10 definitely allows anyone to enjoy the game for its world story and aesthetics while i absolutely loved this game i do think the combat system eventually got overbearing and frustrating as the parry and dodge mechanic got cumbersome rather than enjoyable with some optional mini bosses and bosses basically requiring full parry or fairly high successful dodge rates to even have a chance at winning the battle this feature eventually feels more punishing than enjoyable if you played on normal difficulty as i did some bosses basically end your runs the moment you miss one or two parries or dodges and the intentional arrhythmic pattern makes it hard to predict with sound cues not being very consistent at times imagine playing a rhythm game and they don't accept anything less than full combo even on your first time playing that song that's what it sometimes feels like thankfully there's a story mode difficulty if you're really here just for that with all the extra content you can do in the game and the expansive world it gives you it's still worth it even if the combat system is frustrating however there is no mini map and it can be fairly hard to navigate around and keep track of the ever branching paths of each map and level if you're directionally challenged this would definitely be a major pain point for you overall still worth the purchase and giving it a shot the story constantly kept me excited to go for more and i had a good 20 hours of doing the extra content,True,1760933368,3209,7
1903340,one of the most beautiful and emotional games i've ever played i didn't expect much at first but clair obscure completely blew me away the story is powerful the atmosphere is breathtaking and the soundtrack is a masterpiece i'm currently playing through the epilogue but i can already say this game is work of art 1010,True,1760932123,1414,1
1903340,one of the most cinematic and compelling stories i've came across in media the soundtrack to this game was excellent as well and adds to the immersion and epicness of the game all the main characters were flushed out and well voice acted turnedbased combat is generally not what i enjoy typically but it was as good as it gets there's a lot of replayability with plentiful end game content most definitely game of the year in my book 9410,True,1760931680,3501,19

1903340,by now you have probably seen all the glowing reviews and hype for this game i'm happy to say this is mostly true the characters have interactions that feel genuine the soundtrack is bold fresh and not tiring whatsoever the environments are gorgeous and imaginative of course every rpg needs a good story and this game delivers in ways that i haven't seen in may games in a long while i don't want to spoil anything but i will say i was hooked once i finished the prologue i knew this game was something special i'm probably going to be quoting several lines from this game for a long long time as for the combat yes it's turnbased but it's different than most i found myself needing to be completely engaged when attacking and defending unlike in paper mario the dodges and parries matter sometimes demanding the level of precision you would need in sekiro character builds have major impacts to and you are given so much to experiment with each character has their own style of combat so you will need to manage how to shape each character to the needs of the team which is especially important for the postgame content so i said mostly true and you may be asking yourself why these are mostly minor nitpicks that i can overlook and i've seen much worse from aaa studios the main two issues i have are around character builds 1 they're a bit messy to manipulate and 2 the spike in demand for increasingly better builds really only appear in the late post game content with all that said i thoroughly enjoyed this game start to finish it's a wonderful experience and i hope sandfall keeps making wild and imaginative quality games like this for those who come after,True,1760925829,8454,7
1903340,this game restored the hope i lost over the past few years it managed to bring back the nostalgia of oldschool turnbased rpgs while modernizing the genre and taking everything to an incredibly high level visually technically musically and above all narratively the plot keeps you on edge with constant surprises right up until the end they've managed to create this small yet great gem that's worth every cent my absolute goty this year please do yourself a favor and play it i hope it can inspire future developers to create games with the same passion and care that were poured into this one for those who come after,True,1760924684,6052,1

1903340,an absolute masterpiece,True,1760923547,837,25
1903340,to summarize this game is basically a more mature persona game in both game mechanics additional features and storyline i originally bought this to spit on ubisoft and hearing positive comments about this game from team cherry and from the french president there was a reason that tempted me to get this game in the first two months of its release which was the soundtrack where i only listened to lumiere and was nearly convinced to buy the game i actually regret not buying the game in the first two months of its release because i was in awe in the prologue and got really emotional in the end i'm still in act 2 at the time of typing this review and the story is amazing as it knows when to be serious and a good time to be humorous right now it's the third game that made me shed a tear and the first to make me shed a tear multiple times the game mechanic is really fun it's a turnbased strategy that awards you for precision from attacking at a perfect time or parrying all the enemy's attacks to return the damage to the sender what i like is that despite the game being turnbased there are some enemies where it will never be your turn for a while such as enemies doing four turns before yours or doing infinite turns just because you suck at parrying this might have been me for three attempts for that chromatic enemy however what i have mixed thoughts on are some of the tutorials such as the jump and gradient counter as they never explain that enemies using those attacks meant you should be ready to parry not to immediately parry as i did a lot in my first hour in act 2,True,1760923366,2379,25

1903340,modern classic bruh the narrative is very confident and u already give a gaf about it two minutes in the events between each of the acts are unforgettable and it's obviously best experienced blind so i'll shut up on that end i think calling the design revolutionary or innovative is misleading because the mechanics are instead thoroughly inspired by some of the best jrpgs in history and just smashes em all together into one of the best gameplay loops i've played thru in years with a lot of flexibility and an emphasis on making fun kits expert mode is just challenging enough for somebody who is a little too busy to sit on a challenging boss for a week but if you're looking for some souls bs or are worried it will be too easy the postgame will change your mind especially one optional fight my one complaint is that although the soundtrack is probably my favorite ost ever it's implemented a little awkwardly i understand what they were going for with the adaptive battlearea themes and sometimes it works well but looping the first section of a song over and over is not really how music is supposed to be structured for listening i found the moments where i'm finally listening to amazing tracks like the paintress theme ingame and not on spotify for the 500th time kind of disappointing combat music choice in general for several sections in the act 3postgame also felt a little repetitive they could've picked more than the handful they did and pumped more hype into a few of the superbosses in fact some tracks like atelier de clea contre le coeur that have great vocals never play the vocals throughout the entire game to extent of my knowledgeresearch i think it would've been a wiser choice for sandfall to drop some of the sound engineering and let lorien testard's phenomenal tracks speak for themselves in a few sections again though i am only complaining about this because i have listened to the soundtrack religiously since first booting the game up several months ago this one of the best osts and general sets of orchestrations ever and it's a shame that i think it sounds best on spotify 1010 experience nonetheless i'm curious if other people feel the same about the soundtrack or if i just listened to it too much outside of the game bc i love it 3,True,1760917096,4476,5

1903340,as much as i would love to indulge my contrarian self and as shameful as it is for me to praise what is essentially persona made by the french i must agree with the rest of the faceless goons creeping around this platform yes indeed although the capacity for joy has all but left my mortal shell expedition 33 is all i have come to demand from a video game and more a product of passion not greed brought forth by valued craftsmen not employees motivated by their own artistic integrity not projected revenue i can hardly believe this is the team's first project where did these people even come from and where have they been all our lives doubtless a mystery for historians to ponder now my religion usually forbids me to engage in monetary transactions unless there's money to be saved and i was resigned to the prospect of waiting a good two years or longer for a chance at a big discount fortunately for my wallet however and unfortunately for my dignity as an independent human being i happen to be acquainted with a dumb little gremlin who's allergic to money if by any chance you're reading this i appreciate the gesture don't do it again so anyway here i am booting up the hot new thing and notredame de paris my room is on fire games aren't supposed to have so many particle effects why if my computer was a woman she would be begging me to divorce her to little avail of course my enjoyment of the game is way more important than a robot wife's comfort which is to say the level of detail is astounding the environments are whimsical and dreamlike the characters are incredibly well realized and the lumina system allows me to ruin some of the greatest boss fights ever seen with my degenerate strategies actually while we're on the topic of characters i'm eternally grateful to the developers for allowing me to play as an adult man who doesn't have to rely on his governmentmandated surrogate child to emote on his behalf all the time quite refreshing indeed but i will be forced to deduct ten points for dear gustave's pseudobionic arm a trope which i feel has gotten just a little tired gee gustave you're just so cool with your irrelevant disability and lack of symmetry can somebody tell me why every modern protagonist has to be missing an arm why is it always one arm talk trash about human revolution all you like at least jensen had the balls to go all the way man was missing both of those suckers and then some and what's so special about fake arms anyway i see this crap in every game i play metal arms wooden arms living arms magic arms gun arms sword arms arms that explode arms that electrocute arms with grappling hooks arms that vibrate your position in spacetime arms that make you coffee in the morning arms that hold you tight and say they love you no really we do we were wrong to leave you we're happy to be your parents and we're proud of you i'm sick of it we have four limbs don't we when are we going to see doom guy jumping over a demon with his deployable spring legs like he's inspector gadget never that's when because game developers are a bunch of quacks bigger than my psychologist where was i ah yes presentation especially the part of it which pertains to sound design fun fact human beings are just as emotionally responsive to sound as they are to colour perhaps even more so the former i considered adding a little something about olfactory memory to go with that statement too but decided against it i don't think we as an industry are ready for that conversation and besides this game review's already too long as it is but regardless it's clear that sandfall put a lot of effort and resources into making sure that the score was varied and the actors had clear and proper direction in fact even more so than the writing or the art direction by themselves already miles above the standard fare i'd go so far as to cite the voice acting as the primary reason behind this game's success i cannot in all honesty recall the last time i experienced such consistently lifelike performances across an entire cast in a featurelength rpg no less but i could absolutely come up with a list of the past one hundred times i ended up rolling my eyes at badly written and delivered dialogue in an otherwise perfectly serviceable story which is strange isn't it it's almost as if having the characters talk it out like real people directly correlates to stronger audience engagement and therefore bigger returns on your investment yet it's nearly always a footnote in the development process and i just don't seem to know why but i do know what i want i want better music and dialogue in video games i want to see the clashing of different ideologies i want to care about the characters and their stuggles i want to feel sad when they're sad and feel mad when they're mad i want empathy because feeling is what separates art from entertainment and i've no money to spare for toys i want more clair obscur and less robot arms,True,1760909103,4563,19
1903340,from beginning to end this game is epic the story telling unique and creative characters and the immersive environments i can't believe expedition 33 is sandfalls first title truly remarkable i 1010 recommend and i look forward to what they come up with next game of the year contender for sure,True,1760907907,3478,2
1903340,to me art should not be propaganda of particular ideals it should allow the observer to have their own interpretation the choice you make at the end of the game is exactly what makes clair obscur 33 a good piece of art this game delivers an emotional journey and interactions with characters that make you feel the weight of your decision there are no good or bad guysthere is just being human and how you deal with loss in addition to the themes of loss the game explores a few other thoughtprovoking themes aside from the beautiful story the music visuals and combat in this game are outstanding this game is and will be a real powerful memory in my neural networks well done sandfall,True,1760906222,3691,6

1903340,this game is as good as everyone says if not better story wise this is one of the most beautiful story you can find in a video game you should play blind visuals wise well i think you can see how amazing it is gameplay wise it's one of the few turn based games that are actually interesting to play my only complain would be that you can easily get lost in the exploration there is so much to do beside the main objective and a lot of it is way too hard to do at your current level so you can easily get overwhelmed by insane side mobs that one shot you tho if you're not like me just don't go in the red portals with a big danger label on it and you'll be fine,True,1760899954,2774,12
1903340,where do i even start for quite some time now i've been trying to find a game that sparks my love for gaming the same way i felt when i was younger i'm not going to lie when i say i had zero interest in expedition 33 my uncle showed it to me initially and it looked a bit cool but still i wasn't interested until one day i had received a gift on may 9th from my uncle i decided why not it doesn't hurt to play it for a little bit at first the intro to the game was a bit confusing to me and didn't really make sense this gave me a purpose to continue playing i played more and more and i just couldn't stop until i got all the achievements beat the game and finish the side stories but even with finishing nearly everything the game had to offer i then started a ng run to feel the story again to see the foreshadowing that i missed out before run around the environments to collect things the gameplay is immensely satisfying to me along with the beautiful music and the raw and natural story all this sparked my interest in gaming again i strive to find an original concept like this game again in the future all in all this game is whoooo but also wheeee so the wheeee balances the whoooo for those who come after tomorrow comes ps to my uncle thank you for gifting me this game if you didn't i would have never played it and i would have missed out on this life changing experience learn from those who came before and lay the trail for those who come after,True,1760899343,6373,8
1903340,while the score and the image are beautiful and the theme is profound and thoughtprovoking the story is a bit too long and gets tedious in act 2 besides i cannot stress this enough do not play the game if you are not a jrpg fan turns out i'm not and the gameplay made miserable i find it sooooo mindnumingly boring having to memorize cues for parries and dodging euh no real tactics just thumb reflexes,True,1760899223,3919,5
1903340,i too am whooo but i'm also wheee so the wheee balances the whooo,True,1760898781,2720,7
1903340,so the art in the game is near perfect and the story is relatively interesting this doesnt feel like a game though it feels like reading a novel the gameplay part of this game is not inovative at all and gets dry very fast maybe im forgeting that this game was ment for consoles but still game runs smoothly but considering you are pretty much just going in a beautiful space with minimal interaction i expect smooth running is not a problem as there is nothing thats going on in the background so beatuiful art bad gameplay i bought it to due to so many positive comments and i didnt refund to support the developers as they are on to something,True,1760898724,1227,8
1903340,excellent game gameplay remembers me the best classic fnal fantasy with many improvements and qol added music is awesome graphics are great not that much moved by the story but overall it carries a lot of emotions french audio is really good try it with your favourite subtitles instead of going for the english version,True,1760897964,3960,47

1903340,i have so many feelings about this game love passion heartbreak frustration essentially i admire expedition 33 deeply as a work of art but have mixed feelings on some of the gameplay i've written a short essay the impeccable story one of the most well written complex emotional stories i have ever experienced i cried in the prologue and sobbed uncontrollably in the epilogue the characters were so real and complicated the worldbuilding was unique and engrossing and the plot twisted at every turn and kept me glued to the screen through every cutscene this game deserves an arsenal of emmys for the cinematography and acting truly a masterpiece art the primary theme of this game is art and the art of the game itself did not disappoint i loved exploring the wildly illustrated world seeing what new and twisted enemy would come on the screen next and took so many screenshots i could make an art book of them the human characters were beautifully animated and so realistic in their expressions and speaking music gorgeous emotional diverse just wow the score of this game ranged from hauntingly beautiful vocals to screamo punk to classical piano to grooving funk and yet all of it somehow incomprehensibly blended together and formed a single aesthetic consistent with the game character builds i loved the system of weapons skills pictosluminas and stat points each character had an entirely unique and fascinating system of fighting but within each preset build you had so much agency to customize their specializations it was a lot to learn but i really enjoyed it once i understood it and have never seen anything like the builds e33 presented the mixed fighting i did enjoy the mix of turnbased and realtime blockparrycounterattack it was engaging and worked seamlessly in battles i really enjoyed the longer boss fights where i could master the timings of all the different attacks and build up skills throughout the fight to stack bigger and bigger damage payoffs however early game fights were super repetitive and tedious i felt like i ran into an enemy every other step and had to start the same fight over and over again with limited skills that bored me it was fun that every new type of enemy had new attacks to learn but all the side fights just felt like a grind this did improve throughout the game somewhat as skills became more complex but i still got bored by the repetition the not great pacing despite 8 months of anticipation for this game and my overflowing enthusiasm when i first started it i almost quit multiple times in the first 10 hours that's how long it took me to recruit all act 1 characters 10 hours the start of this game was just so slow i appreciate that each character had unique fighting styles to learn but really sandfall we're a bit smarter than you give us credit for i was so bored during the early levels and the builds took a long time to gain power and complexity once i got to act ii the pacing picked up significantly but then slowed again in act iii lack of structure i spent so much time in act i wandering around getting lost and not knowing where to go next the lack of maps within regions drove me absolutely insane and the single listed quest at any given time was essentially keep playing the game i'm sure some people enjoyed the 'explore and find out for yourself' style of this game but i would have appreciated just a 'bit' more direction via maps and objectives once again act ii was much better than act i in this regard but then act iii went back to the 'figure it out for yourself' model i don't know how i would have gotten through act iii without online guides telling me where new areas were and which ones i could handle at what level conclusion so would i recommend this game yes i can't stop thinking about it i think e33 deserves its accolades for being a cinematic masterpiece for its unique buildsfighting and for its origins in a humble french developer who sold millions of copies in the first few months i do think the game could be improved in many ways and it wasn't the greatest gameplay experience i've ever had the inconsistent pacing and lack of structure frustrated me to no end but overall i was deeply affected by this game and i think that deserves a lot of credit,True,1760895647,3194,4
1903340,quite simply this game is worth every penny can take a bit for the combat rhythm to click very tight on expert mode but the lower difficulties are very doable even expedition mode as it is a lot more forgiving with the damage you are dealt i have thoroughly enjoyed my experience exploring the world so far a must have,True,1760895225,1830,12

1903340,this is the best rpg i've ever played in my life i don't think i'll come across another game anytime soon that will make me feel such a wide range of emotions the world the characters the music the story and the combat were some of the best i've ever experienced in any game every character i had the pleasure of meeting from the heroes and npcs to the antagonists especially the antagonists was phenomenally portrayed excellently acted and genuinely interesting i hope that once the developers have had some rest and find another great idea they'll decide to create another masterpiece like this one however i sincerely hope they won't feel pressured to do so and that they won't make a game without the same passion that can be felt in every element of this production to jest najlepsze rpg w jakie kiedykolwiek graem w yciu nie sdz e w najbliszym czasie trafi na inn gr ktra wywoa u mnie tak wiele rnych emocji wiat postacie muzyka fabua i system walki byy jednymi z najlepszych jakich dowiadczyem w jakiejkolwiek grze kada posta ktr miaem przyjemno spotka od bohaterw i npcw po antagonistw zwaszcza antagonistw bya fenomenalnie przedstawiona doskonale zagrana i naprawd interesujca mam nadziej e kiedy twrcy odpoczn i znajd kolejny wietny pomys zdecyduj si stworzy kolejne takie arcydzieo jednak szczerze mam nadziej e nie bd czuli si do tego zmuszeni i nie zrobi gry bez tej samej pasji ktr po prostu czu w kadym elemencie tej produkcji,True,1760892863,2902,10
1903340,simply put this is one of the best pieces of fictional media ever made and it just so happens to be in video game form the story is incredible the visuals are stunning and the music is absolutely breathtaking i think this may very well have the best intro to any game ever created guaranteed to hook you in the first half hour all the different elements of this game mix and mash perfectly and compliment each other so well the combat is the only thing about this game i think you might find subjective it is a turn based system but it is a very active turn based system there is very much a get good factor with this game as far as parrying and dodging goes especially if you choose to play on the higher difficulties as the windows to pull off these mechanics are extremely tight graphically it's not perfect there are moments where characters handsobjects they are holding clip through clothing or environment but none of these moments are egregious in my opinion that being said it's probably the only downside to this game graphically as the environments skills characters cutscenes and effects are gorgeous characters are relatable and behave like real people the writing done for this game was immaculate musically this game has something for just about everybody the soundtrack for this game is so diverse you are bound to find a track that you can really vibe with i think that this games soundtrack will comfortably sit among the greatest ost's of all time all things considered this very well may be the best game i have ever played and it easily sits in my top 10 favorite games of all time maybe even top 5 clair obscur expedition 33 is to gaming what the godfather is to movies an absolute masterpiece and a clear reminder that when done correctly creating a video game can be a beautiful work of art worst part about this game is that i'll never be able to experience it for the first time again would recommend this game to literally anybody,True,1760892752,4790,2

1903340,my english vocabulary is too small to describe the range of emotions i felt playing this game i really liked the setting when i first saw the reveal trailer then it turned out it's a turnbased rpg i'm not a big fan of that really but after i saw the reception i decided to give it a try it was one of my best decisions this year this game and marvel midnight suns showed me that turnbased rpgs definitely worth a try it's hard to describe how good this game is this is the first game i played twice in a row and still had fun visuals story and atmosphere are great the soundtrack is something out of this world i don't know what else to say to make someone play this game just buy it and play i hope you won't regret i didn't,True,1760883059,4459,5
1903340,clair obscur expedition 33 completely blew me out of the water the world is jawdropping in every scene and the combat feels absolutely amazing i was a bit skeptical at first because i don't really like turnbased games but the parry mechanic makes everything feel so fluid and like so much fun its extremely satisfying the soundtrack absolutely insane it varies from sad piano absolutely amazing vocals from alice and great boss themes that still live in my head and still listen to almost daily i came in as a massive hollow knightsilksong fan and i'm putting this above them even when silksong was an absolute 1010 for me as well that's how special this game is it's a piece of art with a dev team that has put so much love and passion into this game you don't get these type of games often so i hope this is a sign to all game developers that you dont need big names and multibillion dollar companies to make a great game just pure love passion and talented people both expedition and silksong are great examples what really surprised me the most is how much heart there is in the story it's dark emotional and every chapter pulled me in even deeper the voice acting is phenomenal some of the best i've ever heard that really brings the characters to life and make the emotional scenes hit really hard especially the voice actors of maelle verso and gustave but i also really love renoir's and lune's this isn't just a short rpg either it's packed with sooo much content the main story itself is already filled with content but now that i completed that part there is still so much to explore with hidden bosses and weapons and all the ways you can experiment with skills and builds this is one of those rare games that comes along and completely raises the bar for me it's not just a great game not just the best game of this year but it might even be my favorite game of all time i know that recency bias exists so i also don't want to be too definitive about this statement but i also don't want to take away any credits from this game that it absolutely deserves,True,1760882380,2603,24

1903340,story writing audio art style execution 1010 gameplay 710 this is without a doubt one of those games that will go down in history as one those rare gems every gamer should know about and play even if you don't enjoy the gameplay fair enough put it on easy and roll through everything else about this experience is absolutely worth it to dive in for that this game came from a rather inexperienced firsttimer team and the writing in particular from a writer who has no published works beforehand and mostly just wrote for herself is they deserve every award they will receive there are some issues though that shouldn't be ignored why oh why is there no repeat battle button instead you have to wait until enemies finish you off if you want to restart a battle utter waste of time why when you repeat a battle does the cinematic before the battle repeat as well sure you can skip that but why even repeat it in the first place waste of time again some bosses have multiple phases which is nice but why is there no checkpoint inbetween them in all cases a boss's first phase is drastically easier than the second and once you are able to get to the second phase you won't struggle with the first anymore this lack of a checkpoint here is again a waste of time there is great depth to the combat system in theory all the effects synergies and the ways the characters interact with each other it could be great if it weren't for one thing even minmaxing doesn't do a whole lot of difference if you don't master the parrying on hard and if you do master the parrying it is really all you need and you can ignore all the other systems those two parts of the combat are at odds with each other designwise with the realtime parts making all the rest almost entirely superficial the combat would have been better with a more traditional turnbased system as well as with a more traditional realtime system some of the encounters feel more like gotchas that were made annoying on purpose to mess with the player not a fan of design like that,True,1760872254,2600,248

1903340,before playing this game i had heard and seen the insane amount of praise around it and i was kinda skeptical and since i wasn't in the mood for a turn based rpg at the time it launched i dismissed it for the time after half a year now i finally decided to give it a try and i think the biggest praise i can give it in one sentence is this at least for me it lives up to all the praise and then some i don't want to discuss this game in too much detail here as to not spoil things but i will say some general things still since i cannot help myself but praise the game now that i've seen basically all it has to offer the presentation and artstyle are just absolutely beautiful the music and overall story are genuinely close to if not on par with nier automata which for me still is probably the pinnacle of this medium in these two regards and on top of all of this it somehow is also probably my favourite turn based rpg in terms of its actual gameplay and this cannot be understated like this game a turn based rpg which i wouldn't really say is my favourite genre of games generally reached the same heights with at least some of its fights my favourite being a very late game optional boss for me that fighting learning and overcoming a really good hard fight in something like elden ring dark souls 3 or sekiro reached that is not at all something i was expecting to get out of a turn based rpg let alone one made by a pretty small team so yea honestly huge respect and praise to the devs this joins the collection of games i would point to as a counterargument whenever anyone tries to argue that games are not art if you are even remotely interested in this game go get it and play it when you are able to it really is one of those games that you really owe it to yourself to experience and so another entry into my all time favourites has been made side by side with hollow knight silksong this really is one hell of year,True,1760869197,3675,38

1903340,you're telling me this is a game from an indie studio okay further research suggests calling this indie is apparently a controversy but still is beyond my expectations the story the environments the characters and the soundtrack all painted a beautiful experience that's fun emotional and makes you really care for the world as a whole the combat gameplay continuously surprised me and delivered beyond my expectations i never expected a game like this to release with an almost aaa feel without costing 80 i wish i spent more time exploring because i feel i definitely missed some side adventures for those who come after,True,1760868310,1915,5

1903340,an excellent rpg that serves as a french interpretation of the modern final fantasy series with elements of super mario rpg or legend of dragoon and chrono trigger while most of the story beats are similar enough to those inspirations to lack any real surprise element the presentation is excellent enough to place it on par with the best of them overall this is essentially the kind of game fans of final fantasy have been wanting from a final fantasy ever since x which we sadly never got hopefully this quells any of the misguided assumptions that these kinds of games can't be successful in the modern era looking forward to a sequel for what will come after i would highly suggest,True,1760864740,6057,6

1903340,to say that clair obscur expedition 33 might be one of my personal favourite games of the past few years would be an understatement in an era where game design has become corporate and stale only following whatever is currently popular expedition 33 dared not only to follow its own path but also to provide one of the most enthralling and immersive stories of the past decade the world feels real the story once it grips you never lets go until that final line and the characters are as fleshed out as some of the best protagonists in gaming this isn't even talking about the gameplay which is arguably the most important aspect of any game it's rare i find the combat in a jrpg as engaging as this challenging but rewarding combat never once became stale with so much depth underneath the surface yet not once does it fall into the usual trap of becoming too complicated to build characters in a specific way my biggest gripe outside of some minor nitpicks is the performance unreal engine 5 is of infamous at this point for its issues in truth it feels kind of unfair to bring this up as this is mostly out of the hands of developers and the fault entirely lies on epic for this i do not believe that a game like this could exist on any other engine and truthfully it is hardly the worst optimisation i've seen in a game of this scale hence why i can still recommend it i just ask that people double check their hardware before buying as to avoid disappointment but even then a game of this scale for around 40 roughly 50 usd is hard to say no to even if you're not a fan of jrpgs i can safely say you'll hardly be disappointed here just give it a chance,True,1760860251,2331,7

1903340,with all of the glaze this game receives it's near impossible to avoid hearing about it when it came onto my radar i waived it off because i've never been too big a fan of the jrpg style turnbased combat but after i kept hearing about it i decided to pick it up to check it out and i am glad to say that expedition 33 deserves every single compliment it receives despite of my usual dislike of this style of game i enjoyed every second of playing this one the story is incredibly interesting and compelling the characters are likable and wellwritten the soundtrack is consistently great and the gameplay is innovative and expansive i don't want to say too much more and risk spoiling anything but if you are reading this review you should absolutely get the game you're practically guaranteed to enjoy it,True,1760853851,3719,117
1903340,expedition 33 draws inspiration from a number of classic jrpgs and intelligently took many of their strengths and combined them the combat system is simple yet fun with engaging parrydodge mechanics added it doesn't artificially limit you from making powerful builds and eventually breaking the game uses hub world navigation similar to older ff games the graphics are unique but very well done and immersive and it's a rarity for ue5 games to run well these days but it does the best part of the game easily is the music sound work and story the good gameplay is just a hook for exploring these,True,1760853381,3406,2

1903340,by now i doubt there is much i could add to the praise this game has gotten is it perfect no but it is damn close the story the settings the characters and soundtrack are all incredible and despite the heavy story content so much fun the second level had me panning the camera around just to look at all the neat things that were happening the acting in the story scenes was particularly good the mocap and finished animations giving each character subtle movements and telling glances so much of the subtext and feelings of each character are done with the eyes in a way that i have not seen in a video game of this scale it really was like watching a movie the story itself is dark and unique and doesn't answer all the questions it asks but it does so in a way that feel natural and real it is a story about grief and loss and dealing with that but its not as overly moody as some indie games can be the gameplay itself and the mechanics is where it starts to show a little bit personally i like feeling like i am playing a god by the end of a good rpg and here well it felt that way a little too soon if you do as much as you can as early as you can leaving the final boss for the end that fight is a pretty short and thats how most fights are if you are under leveled you get trounced unless you have the parrydodge thing down if you are at the right level which you will be for most of the game they are fun with a fair difficulty but if you are slightly overleved like the big monster in the sea wrecked you the first time so you played a bunch of story and side quests gained levels and went oh yeah i should try that again he's a push over the 9999 damage number that was so saught after in the final fantasy days comes quick here does it ruin the game not at all but it does take some of the challenge away if you leave some fights to long at the same time there are a couple of fights that i haven't finished yet because i am not strong enough the other gripe i had was the camera at times and how it works in battles you get a fairy large character to play and he sometimes blocks his own menus i had the camera duck behind tall grasses to get the right angle on an enemies attack and totally block it from view hard to parry that but again it wasnt game breaking but it does keep this game from getting that perfect rating in the end this is a game that needs to be played even with the warts and flaws thi sis an achievment worth celebrating if you like story rich games rpgs deep stories and enjoyable characters play this game,True,1760831491,5867,36

1903340,it's been a few years since i've felt compelled to write a game review but i felt the need to do so after clair obscur expedition 33 became one of my favorite video games of all time my only regret in playing this game is that it may have actually ruined video games for me because of how much better it is compared to most other games i'm just echoing most players when i praise the story the music and the hybrid turnbasedrealtime gameplay as a fan of ff10's gameplay expedition 33 scratched that itch that studios don't release too often anymore i adored the turnbased combat system while mixing in realtime mechanics for dodgingparrying the timing for the parrying system can be challenging at first but you'll get the hang of it in time and the game rewards you for mastering this skill as for the music just spend a couple minutes on the main menu screen and you'll understand what surprised me was how many musical genres were present in this game and how well it all worked together and then there's the story i can count on one hand how many story narratives whether it was a movie a video game a book etc that actually moved me to tears expedition 33 is one of them there's a lot i could discuss here but i'll just mention this i love how expedition 33 manages to create plenty of light and comedic moments in an otherwise dark and bleak world one of my pet peeves in jrpgs is the overuse of fantasy races that primarily serve as comic relief such as the nopon from the xenoblade series the gestrals however provide hilarious moments without being too outofplace with the added bonus that their humor actually contributes to the narrative in a meaningful way i do have a couple critiques for the game though the first one being menu navigation when accessing pictos skills etc it can certainly feel a bit clunky especially when you're in the late game and you have so many pictos to select from as for gameplay it can be quite easy to be overleveled for the final boss which results in the player just demolishing this fight but a quick fix for this would be to unequip the ability that removes your 9999damage cap for the most part these issues didn't really bother me too much after 69 hours of playing expedition 33 i can safely say that this game holds a special place in my heart and i won't soon forget it in time i will give this game another playthrough in ng and try to pick up on all the foreshadowing that i missed throughout my first playthrough what an incredible debut from sandfall interactive and i look forward to seeing what they develop next,True,1760824292,4146,1

1903340,the 15 hours i spent in this game on steam made an impression on me to reward the devs i purchased this on ps5 as well i have no issue buying twice to do my part so sandfall interactive understands i appreciate their hard work graphics on pc are way better but i have 25 hours on my ps5 and i intend to replay it on steam as well amazing game and i will not deduct marks even though i wanted to smash my controller a few times due to the gestral beach mini game,True,1760806797,131,12

1903340,one of the best games i've ever played so good i'm even playing the new game plus mode and on top of that it's such a beautiful game not even just the graphics but the music the voice acting and the story it's just all amazing,True,1760804384,2845,1
1903340,a great story that evoked a storm of emotions it's been a long time since i've been so blown away by a plot twist i even shed a tear at the end beautiful visuals beautiful locations welldesigned characters with lively emotions and unique enemy designs the music is memorable and evokes emotions it's expressive and diverse i bought the soundtrack and my mom asked me what kind of music it was even though she's not interested in games amazing voice acting of the characters unusually lively in the characters you believe gameplay unusual a plus to the game for the ability to take out enemies before they have time to do something i parry and dodge very poorly it's cool that the gameplay for each character is unique skins are cute clair obscur expedition 33 is my nominee for the game of the year yes a lot of goodies came out but a lot or sequels or games straight from famous studios and here we have an original setting and original gameplay,True,1760803238,4863,4
1903340,banger,True,1760801507,1638,12
1903340,great game dragged down by its horrible parrying mechanic and i do genuinely mean the worst possible way to ever implement parrying in a turn based game where your success is bound to parrying attacks most the time you dont even know when to parry unless youve seen the attack before or you got lucky the music didnt cover the sometimes existing sound cue the story is great and the highlight of the game with twists youd never expect intriguing fun etc genuinely the only negative i have with the game is the parrying being a requirement,True,1760800275,2326,86

1903340,an rpg that demands your attention from the very first moments and delivers the same quality of gripping storytelling and emotions every moment through many have praised the gameplay but honestly it's pretty typical jrpg fare with a heavyhanded focus on the timed parry mechanic perfectly serviceable but can overwhelm the rest of the experience on harder tuned fights where this game really shines is everywhere else the story the music the atmosphere and writing characters and humour every bit of this world draws you in and makes you want to stay even when you know you shouldn't a must play,True,1760788202,5571,16

1903340,honestly one of the most engaging and games i have ever played at first i genuinely thought of refunding the game after the first few minutes because i thought that it wasn't a game i would enjoy knowing it was turn based but after the prologue i was hooked and ended up playing for nearly 11 hours straight without realizing it it has one of my favorite soundtracks in gaming now having beat the game i can't comprehend how i thought of refunding such a masterpiece of a gaming experience,True,1760772243,3981,2

1903340,this games story is absolutely game of the year worthy,True,1760767696,2400,12
1903340,cinema,True,1760767496,3451,14
1903340,one of the best movies i've ever seen featuring one of the best soundtracks i've ever heard yet it manages to unapologetically remind you that it's a video game in the most wild of ways all wrapped within a resonating lesson on the nature of what it is to be alive this was a unique experience that i don't anticipate being rivaled for a very long time this is a game made by gamers for gamers thank you sandfall interactive,True,1760766321,9284,4
1903340,absolute masterpiece everything is almost flawless the only thing that's little annoying is that some cutscenes look little pixelated but that's where cons end and of course we can't forget about soundtracks they are literally perfect and are amazingly composed this game is overall a mustplay even if you don't like turn based games i also don't really like turn based games but e33 made the combat system soo good because you will change your mind,True,1760765912,417,7
1903340,good western jrpg with great story telling as long as you can suspend your disbelief you will enjoy this,True,1760765782,3330,91
1903340,repeating same boss again and again and again because every attack has different animation speed is fun as hell would recommend,True,1760765694,1718,2
1903340,perfect game soundtrack character development and visuals it's very deserving of game of the year imo only complaint is the dumb volleyball mini game mechanics that game makes me wanna pull my hair out with how bad the hit reg was working and god forbid you use a controller with a millimeter of stick drift because your character will not move or look the right way 99910 game,True,1760765344,1451,3

1903340,absolute cinema,True,1760764903,10625,1
1903340,it's good like really good i was initially turned off by the fact that it was going to be turn based combat in a final fantasy style type of combat system but i was pleasantly surprised i will be shocked if this doesn't win game of the year the only thing i didn't think was necessary or enjoyable was having to wear a new pictos for 4 fights to unlock it for other characters basically just had to go run off and get into combat with four easy fights and get it learned super quick anyways only taking about a minute but since that minor complaint is only a tiny inconvenience it is easy to overlook and enjoy the rest of it don't look up anything about the game otherwise you will spoilruin a lot of the game for yourself the music combat and story are all enjoyable,True,1760764881,4673,23
1903340,great game especially for a smaller studio,True,1760764405,8803,14
1903340,absolute masterpiece every aspect deserves its praise the big stand out was there is over 8 hours of music yet there is no throw away songs every song is good the story is great and rewards those who pay close attention along the way as it gives away what's happening to those that are invested great story telling and lore design there are bugs but they don't detract from the overall experience,True,1760760928,4835,1
1903340,it's a real masterpiece the storytelling is very innovative and it really changes the game progression the break of expectations and plot twists are insane what you think the game is initially it's not and then you have a whole new game on the same game as the acts progress it's as a new layer is added to the game every new act that's as much as i can say without giving any spoilers the story is heavy and dense and like no game i've ever seen before of course the whole soundtrack is another masterpiece by itself but elevates the game experience so much the mechanics are not exactly new but are updated and modernized making it very fluid it's not perfect i think the battle system is too dependant on the parry which for me is a flaw but that's totally a personal opinion i know some people will find it great,True,1760759525,3749,11
1903340,great game love the fighting style and the story is amazing,True,1760759091,23168,3
